ENAA01,QA01,ENAA,1,"In the name of Allah, most benevolent, ever-merciful."
ENAA02,QA02,ENAA,2,"ALL PRAISE BE to Allah, Lord of all the worlds,"
ENAA03,QA03,ENAA,3,"Most beneficent, ever-merciful,"
ENAA04,QA04,ENAA,4,King of the Day of Judgement.
ENAA05,QA05,ENAA,5,"You alone we worship, and to You alone turn for help."
ENAA06,QA06,ENAA,6,"Guide us (O Lord) to the path that is straight,"
ENAA07,QA07,ENAA,7,"The path of those You have blessed, Not of those who have earned Your anger, nor those who have gone astray."
ENAA08,QA08,ENAA,8,ALIF LAM MIM.
ENAA09,QA09,ENAA,9,"This is The Book free of doubt and involution, a guidance for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path,"
ENAA10,QA10,ENAA,10,"Who believe in the Unknown and fulfil their devotional obligations, and spend in charity of what We have given them;"
ENAA11,QA11,ENAA,11,"Who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to those before you, and are certain of the Hereafter."
ENAA12,QA12,ENAA,12,They have found the guidance of their Lord and will be successful.
ENAA13,QA13,ENAA,13,"As for those who deny, it is all the same if you warn them or not, they will not believe."
ENAA14,QA14,ENAA,14,"God has sealed their hearts and ears, and veiled their eyes. For them is great deprivation."
ENAA15,QA15,ENAA,15,"And there are some who, though they say: ""We believe in God and the Last Day,"" (in reality) do not believe."
ENAA16,QA16,ENAA,16,"They (try to) deceive God and those who believe, yet deceive none but themselves although they do not know."
ENAA17,QA17,ENAA,17,"Sick are their hearts, and God adds to their malady. For them is suffering for they lie."
ENAA18,QA18,ENAA,18,"When asked to desist from spreading corruption in the land they say: ""Why, we are reformers."""
ENAA19,QA19,ENAA,19,"Yet they are surely mischief-mongers, even though they do not know."
ENAA20,QA20,ENAA,20,"When asked to believe as others do, they say: ""Should we believe like fools?"" And yet they are the fools, even though they do not know."
ENAA21,QA21,ENAA,21,"When they meet the faithful they say: ""We believe;"" but when alone with the devils (their fellows), they say: ""We are really with you; we were joking."""
ENAA22,QA22,ENAA,22,But God will turn the joke against them and allow them to sink deeper into evil and wander perplexed in their wickedness.
ENAA23,QA23,ENAA,23,"They are indeed those who bartered away good guidance for error and gained nothing from the deal, nor found the right way."
ENAA24,QA24,ENAA,24,"They are like a man who kindles a fire, and when its glow has illumined the air God takes away their light leaving them in the dark where they will not be able to see."
ENAA25,QA25,ENAA,25,"They are deaf, dumb and blind, and shall never return;"
ENAA26,QA26,ENAA,26,"Or like rain pouring from the sky which hides within it darkness, thunder and lightning. They thrust their fingers into their ears for safety against noise and death. But God surrounds those who believe not from all sides."
ENAA27,QA27,ENAA,27,Verily the lightning could snatch away their eyes. When it flashes forth they walk in its flare. When darkness returns they stand still. And if the Lord wills so He could take away their hearing and sight; surely God is all-powerful.
ENAA28,QA28,ENAA,28,"So, O you people, adore your Lord who created you, as He did those before you, that you could take heed for yourselves and fear Him"
ENAA29,QA29,ENAA,29,"Who made the earth a bed for you, the sky a canopy, and sends forth rain from the skies that fruits may grow -- your food and sustenance. So, do not make another the equal of God knowingly."
ENAA30,QA30,ENAA,30,"If you are in doubt of what We have revealed to Our votary, then bring a Surah like this, and call any witness, apart from God, you like, if you are truthful."
ENAA31,QA31,ENAA,31,"But if you cannot, as indeed you cannot, then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is men and rocks, which has been prepared for the infidels."
ENAA32,QA32,ENAA,32,"Announce to those who believe and have done good deeds, glad tidings of gardens under which rivers flow, and where, when they eat the fruits that grow, they will say: ""Indeed they are the same as we were given before,"" so like in semblance the food would be. And they shall have fair spouses there, and live there abidingly."
ENAA33,QA33,ENAA,33,"God is not loath to advance the similitude of a gnat or a being more contemptible; and those who believe know whatever is from the Lord is true. But those who disbelieve say: ""What does God mean by this parable?"" He causes some to err this way, and some He guides; yet He turns away none but those who transgress,"
ENAA34,QA34,ENAA,34,"Who, having sealed it, break God's covenant, dividing what He ordained cohered; and those who spread discord in the land will suffer assuredly."
ENAA35,QA35,ENAA,35,Then how can you disbelieve in God? He gave you life when you were dead. He will make you die again then bring you back to life: To Him then you will return.
ENAA36,QA36,ENAA,36,"He made for you all that lies within the earth, then turning to the firmament He proportioned several skies: He has knowledge of everything."
ENAA37,QA37,ENAA,37,"Remember, when your Lord said to the angels: ""I have to place a trustee on the earth,"" they said: ""Will You place one there who would create disorder and shed blood, while we intone Your litanies and sanctify Your name?"" And God said: ""I know what you do not know."""
ENAA38,QA38,ENAA,38,"Then He gave Adam knowledge of the nature and reality of all things and everything, and set them before the angels and said: ""Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful."""
ENAA39,QA39,ENAA,39,"And they said: ""Glory to You (O Lord), knowledge we have none except what You have given us, for You are all-knowing and all-wise."""
ENAA40,QA40,ENAA,40,"Then He said to Adam: ""Convey to them their names."" And when he had told them, God said: ""Did I not tell you that I know the unknown of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you disclose and know what you hide?"""
ENAA41,QA41,ENAA,41,"Remember, when We asked the angels to bow in homage to Adam, they all bowed but Iblis, who disdained and turned insolent, and so became a disbeliever."
ENAA42,QA42,ENAA,42,"And We said to Adam: ""Both you and your spouse live in the Garden, eat freely to your fill wherever you like, but approach not this tree or you will become transgressors."
ENAA43,QA43,ENAA,43,"But Satan tempted them and had them banished from the (happy) state they were in. And We said: ""Go, one the antagonist of the other, and live on the earth for a time ordained, and fend for yourselves."""
ENAA44,QA44,ENAA,44,Then his Lord sent commands to Adam and turned towards him: Indeed He is compassionate and kind.
ENAA45,QA45,ENAA,45,"And We said to them: ""Go, all of you. When I send guidance, whoever follows it will neither have fear nor regret;"
ENAA46,QA46,ENAA,46,"But those who deny and reject Our signs will belong to Hell, and there abide unchanged."""
ENAA47,QA47,ENAA,47,"O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you. So keep your pledge to Me, and I will mine to you, and be fearful of Me,"
ENAA48,QA48,ENAA,48,"And believe in what I have sent down which verifies what is already with you; and do not be the first to deny it, nor part with it for little gain; and beware of Me."
ENAA49,QA49,ENAA,49,"Do not confuse truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly."
ENAA50,QA50,ENAA,50,"Be firm in devotion; give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others), and bow with those who bow (before God)."
ENAA51,QA51,ENAA,51,"Will you enjoin good deeds on the others and forget your own selves? You also read the Scriptures, why do you then not understand?"
ENAA52,QA52,ENAA,52,"Find strength in fortitude and prayer, which is heavy and exacting but for those who are humble and meek,"
ENAA53,QA53,ENAA,53,"Who are conscious that they have to meet their Lord, and to Him they have to return."
ENAA54,QA54,ENAA,54,"Remember, O children of Israel, the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world."
ENAA55,QA55,ENAA,55,"Take heed of the day when no man will be useful to man in the least, when no intercession matter nor ransom avail, nor help reach them."
ENAA56,QA56,ENAA,56,"Remember, We saved you from the Pharaoh's people who wronged and oppressed you and slew your sons but spared your women: In this was a great favour from your Lord."
ENAA57,QA57,ENAA,57,"Remember, We parted the sea and saved you, and drowned the men of Pharaoh before your very eyes."
ENAA58,QA58,ENAA,58,"Yet, remember, as We communed with Moses for forty nights you took the calf in his absence (and worshipped it), and you did wrong."
ENAA59,QA59,ENAA,59,"Even so, We pardoned you that you may be grateful."
ENAA60,QA60,ENAA,60,"Remember, We gave Moses the Book and Discernment of falsehood and truth, that you may be guided."
ENAA61,QA61,ENAA,61,"Remember, Moses said: ""My people, by taking this calf you have done yourselves harm, so now turn to your Creator in repentance, and kill your pride, which is better with your Lord."" And (the Lord) softened towards you, for He is all-forgiving and merciful."
ENAA62,QA62,ENAA,62,"Remember, when you said to Moses: ""We shall not believe in you until we see God face to face,"" lightning struck you as you looked."
ENAA63,QA63,ENAA,63,Even then We revived you after you had become senseless that you might give thanks;
ENAA64,QA64,ENAA,64,"And made the cloud spread shade over you, and sent for you manna and quails that you may eat of the good things We have made for you. No harm was done to Us, they only harmed themselves."
ENAA65,QA65,ENAA,65,"And remember, We said to you: ""Enter this city, eat wherever you like, as much as you please, but pass through the gates in humility and say: 'May our sins be forgiven.' We shall forgive your trespasses and give those who do good abundance."
ENAA66,QA66,ENAA,66,"But the wicked changed and perverted the word We had spoken to a word distorted, and We sent from heaven retribution on the wicked, for they disobeyed."
ENAA67,QA67,ENAA,67,"And remember, when Moses asked for water for his people, We told him to strike the rock with his staff, and behold, twelve springs of gushing water gushed forth so that each of the tribes came to know its place of drinking. Eat and drink, (enjoy) God's gifts, and spread no discord in the land."
ENAA68,QA68,ENAA,68,"Remember, when you said: ""O Moses, we are tired of eating the same food (day after day), ask your Lord to give us fruits of the earth, herbs and cucumbers, grains and lentils and onions;"" he said: ""Would you rather exchange what is good with what is bad? Go then to the city, you shall have what you ask."" So they were disgraced and became indigent, earning the anger of God, for they disbelieved the word of God, and slayed the prophets unjustly, for they transgressed and rebelled."
ENAA69,QA69,ENAA,69,"Surely the believers and the Jews, Nazareans and the Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day, and whosoever does right, shall have his reward with his Lord and will neither have fear nor regret."
ENAA70,QA70,ENAA,70,"Remember the day We made the covenant with you and exalted you on the Mount and said: ""Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is therein that you may take heed."""
ENAA71,QA71,ENAA,71,"But you went back (on your word), and but for the mercy and grace of God you were lost."
ENAA72,QA72,ENAA,72,"You know and have known already those among you who had broken the sanctity of the Sabbath, and to whom We had said: ""Become (like) apes despised,"""
ENAA73,QA73,ENAA,73,"And whom We made an example for the people (of the day) and those after them, and warning for those who fear God."
ENAA74,QA74,ENAA,74,"Remember, when Moses said to his people: ""God demands that you sacrifice a cow,"" they said: ""Are you making fun of us?"" And he said: ""God forbid that I be of the ignorant."""
ENAA75,QA75,ENAA,75,"""Call on your Lord for us,"" they said, ""that He might inform us what kind she should be."" ""Neither old nor young, says God, but of age in between,"" answered Moses. ""So do as you are bid."""
ENAA76,QA76,ENAA,76,"""Call on your Lord,"" they said, ""to tell us the colour of the cow."" ""God says,"" answered Moses, ""a fawn coloured cow, rich yellow, well pleasing to the eye."""
ENAA77,QA77,ENAA,77,"""Call on your Lord,"" they said, ""to name its variety, as cows be all alike to us. If God wills we shall be guided aright."""
ENAA78,QA78,ENAA,78,"And Moses said: ""He says it's a cow unyoked, nor worn out by ploughing or watering the fields, one in good shape with no mark or blemish."" ""Now have you brought us the truth,"" they said; and then, after wavering, they sacrificed the cow."
ENAA79,QA79,ENAA,79,"Remember when you killed a man and blamed each other for the deed, God brought to light what you concealed."
ENAA80,QA80,ENAA,80,"We had pronounced already: ""Slay (the murderer) for (taking a life)."" Thus God preserves life from death and shows you His signs that you may understand."
ENAA81,QA81,ENAA,81,"Yet, in spite of this, your hearts only hardened like rocks or even harder, but among rocks are those from which rivers flow; and there are also those which split open and water gushes forth; as well as those that roll down for fear of God. And God is not negligent of all that you do."
ENAA82,QA82,ENAA,82,"How do you expect them to put their faith in you, when you know that some among them heard the word of God and, having understood, perverted it knowingly?"
ENAA83,QA83,ENAA,83,"For when they meet the faithful, they say: ""We believe;"" but when among themselves, they say: ""Why do you tell them what the Lord has revealed to you? They will only dispute it in the presence of your Lord. Have you no sense indeed?"""
ENAA84,QA84,ENAA,84,Do they not know that God is aware of what they hide and what they disclose?
ENAA85,QA85,ENAA,85,"Among them are heathens who know nothing of the Book but only what they wish to believe, and are only lost in fantasies."
ENAA86,QA86,ENAA,86,"But woe to them who fake the Scriptures and say: ""This is from God,"" so that they might earn some profit thereby; and woe to them for what they fake, and woe to them for what they earn from it!"
ENAA87,QA87,ENAA,87,"Yet they say: ""The Fire will not touch us for more than a few days."" Say.. ""Have you so received a promise from God?"" ""Then surely God will not withdraw His pledge. Or do you impute things to God of which you have no knowledge at all?"""
ENAA88,QA88,ENAA,88,"Why, they who have earned the wages of sin and are enclosed in error, are people of Hell, where they will abide for ever."
ENAA89,QA89,ENAA,89,"But those who believe and do good deeds are people of Paradise, and shall live there forever."
ENAA90,QA90,ENAA,90,"Remember, when We made a covenant with the people of Israel and said: ""Worship no one but God, and be good to your parents and your kin, and to orphans and the needy, and speak of goodness to men; observe your devotional obligations, and give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others),"" you went back (on your word), except only a few, and paid no heed."
ENAA91,QA91,ENAA,91,"And remember, when We made a covenant with you whereby you agreed you will neither shed blood among you nor turn your people out of their homes, you promised, and are witness to it too."
ENAA92,QA92,ENAA,92,"But you still kill one another, and you turn a section of your people from their homes, assisting one another against them with guilt and oppression. Yet when they are brought to you as captives you ransom them, although forbidden it was to drive them away. Do you, then, believe a part of the Book and reject a part? There is no other award for them who so act but disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement the severest of punishment; for God is not heedless of all that you do."
ENAA93,QA93,ENAA,93,They are those who bought the life of the world at the cost of the life to come; and neither will their torment decrease nor help reach them.
ENAA94,QA94,ENAA,94,"Remember We gave Moses the Book and sent after him many an apostle; and to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear evidence of the truth, reinforcing him with divine grace. Even so, when a messenger brought to you what did not suit your mood you turned haughty, and called some imposters and some others you slew."
ENAA95,QA95,ENAA,95,"And they say: ""Our hearts are enfolded in covers."" In fact God has cursed them for their unbelief; and only a little do they believe."
ENAA96,QA96,ENAA,96,"And when the Book was sent to them by God verifying what had been revealed to them already even though before it they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers and even though they recognised it when it came to them, they renounced it. The curse of God be on those who deny!"
ENAA97,QA97,ENAA,97,"They bartered their lives ill denying the revelation of God out of spite that God should bestow His grace among His votaries on whomsoever He will, and thus earned wrath upon wrath. The punishment for disbelievers is ignominious."
ENAA98,QA98,ENAA,98,"And when it is said to them: ""believe in what God has sent down,"" they say: ""We believe what was sent to us, and do not believe what has come thereafter,"" although it affirms the truth they possess already. Say: ""Why have you then been slaying God's apostles as of old, if you do believe?"""
ENAA99,QA99,ENAA,99,"Although Moses had come to you with evidence of the truth, you chose the calf in his absence, and you transgressed."
ENAA100,QA100,ENAA,100,"Remember when We took your pledge and exalted you on the Mount (saying:) ""Hold fast to what We have given you, firmly, and pay heed,"" you said: ""We have heard and will not obey."" (The image of) the calf had sunk deep into their hearts on account of unbelief. Say: ""Vile is your belief if you are believers indeed!"""
ENAA101,QA101,ENAA,101,"Tell them: ""If you think you alone will abide with God to the exclusion of the rest of Mankind, in the mansions of the world to come, then wish for death if what you say is true."""
ENAA102,QA102,ENAA,102,But they will surely not wish for death because of what they had done in the past; and God knows the sinners well.
ENAA103,QA103,ENAA,103,"You will see they are covetous of life more than other men, even more than those who practise idolatry. Each one of them desires to live a thousand years, although longevity will never save them from punishment, for God sees all they do."
ENAA104,QA104,ENAA,104,"Say: ""Whosoever is the enemy of Gabriel who revealed the word of God to you by the dispensation of God, reaffirming what had been revealed before, and is a guidance and good news for those who believe, --"
ENAA105,QA105,ENAA,105,"Whosoever is the enemy of God and His angels and apostles, and of Gabriel and Michael, then God is the enemy of such unbelievers."""
ENAA106,QA106,ENAA,106,"We have sent clear signs to you, such as none can deny except those who transgress the truth."
ENAA107,QA107,ENAA,107,"And every time they made a pledge some of them pushed it aside, and many of them do not believe."
ENAA108,QA108,ENAA,108,"When a messenger was sent to them by God affirming the Books they had already received, some of them put (His message) behind their backs as if they had no knowledge of it."
ENAA109,QA109,ENAA,109,"And they follow what devilish beings used to chant against the authority of Solomon, though Solomon never disbelieved and only the devils denied, who taught sorcery to men, which, they said, had been revealed to the angels of Babylon, Harut and Marut, who, however, never taught it without saying: ""We have been sent to deceive you, so do not renounce (your faith)."" They learnt what led to discord between husband and wife. Yet they could not harm any one or without the dispensation of God. And they learnt what harmed them and brought no gain. They knew indeed whoever bought this had no place in the world to come, and that surely they had sold themselves for something that was vile. If only they had sense!"
ENAA110,QA110,ENAA,110,"Had they come to believe instead, and taken heed for themselves, they would surely have earned from God a far better reward. If only they had sense!"
ENAA111,QA111,ENAA,111,"Say not (to the Prophet), O Believers: ""Have regard for us (ra'ina),"" but ""look at us (unzurna),"" and obey him in what he says. Painful is the nemesis for disbelievers."
ENAA112,QA112,ENAA,112,"Those without faith among the people of the Book, and those who worship idols, do not wish that good should come to you from your Lord. But God chooses whom He likes for His grace; and the bounty of God is infinite."
ENAA113,QA113,ENAA,113,"When We cancel a message (sent to an earlier prophet) or throw it into oblivion, We replace it with one better or one similar. Do you not know that God has power over all things?"
ENAA114,QA114,ENAA,114,"Do you not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that there is none to save and protect you apart from God?"
ENAA115,QA115,ENAA,115,"Do you too, O believers, wish to question your Apostle as Moses was in the past? But he who takes unbelief in exchange for belief only strays from the right path."
ENAA116,QA116,ENAA,116,"How many of the followers of the Books having once known the truth desire in their hearts, out of envy, to turn you into infidels again even after the truth has become clear to them! But you forbear and overlook till God fulfil His plan; and God has power over all things."
ENAA117,QA117,ENAA,117,"Fulfil your devotional obligations and pay the zakat. And what you send ahead of good you will find with God, for He sees all that you do ill."
ENAA118,QA118,ENAA,118,"And they say: ""None will go to Paradise but the Jews and the Christians;"" but this is only wishful thinking. Say: ""Bring the proof if you are truthful."""
ENAA119,QA119,ENAA,119,"Only he who surrenders to God with all his heart and also does good, will find his reward with his Lord, and will have no fear or regret."
ENAA120,QA120,ENAA,120,"The Jews say: ""The Christians are not right,"" and the Christians say: ""The Jews are in the wrong;"" yet both read the Scriptures; and this is what the unread had said too. God alone will judge between them in their differences on the Day of Reckoning."
ENAA121,QA121,ENAA,121,"And who is more unjust than he who prohibits the name of God being used in His mosques, who hurries to despoil them even though he has no right to enter them except in reverence? For them is ignominy in the world and severe punishment in the life to come."
ENAA122,QA122,ENAA,122,To God belong the East and the West. Wherever you turn the glory of God is everywhere: All-pervading is He and all-knowing.
ENAA123,QA123,ENAA,123,"Yet they say that God has begotten a son. May He be praised! Indeed everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and all are obedient to God."
ENAA124,QA124,ENAA,124,"Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothingness, He has only to say when He wills a thing: ""Be"", and it is."
ENAA125,QA125,ENAA,125,"But those who are ignorant say: ""Why does God not speak or show us a sign?"" The same question had been asked by men before them, who were like them in their hearts. But to those who are firm in their faith We have shown Our signs already."
ENAA126,QA126,ENAA,126,And We have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn. You will not be questioned about those and who are inmates of Hell.
ENAA127,QA127,ENAA,127,"The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their way. Say: ""God's guidance alone is true guidance;"" for if you give in to their wishes after having received the (Book of) knowledge from God, then none will you have as friend or helper to save you."
ENAA128,QA128,ENAA,128,"Those to whom We have sent down the Book, and who read it as it should be read, believe in it truly; but those who deny it will be losers."
ENAA129,QA129,ENAA,129,"O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world."
ENAA130,QA130,ENAA,130,"Fear the day when no man will stand up for man in the least, and no ransom avail nor intercession matter nor help reach."
ENAA131,QA131,ENAA,131,"Remember, when his Lord tried Abraham by a number of commands which he fulfilled, God said to him: ""I will make you a leader among men."" And when Abraham asked: ""From my progeny too?"" the Lord said: ""My pledge does not include transgressors."""
ENAA132,QA132,ENAA,132,"Remember, We made the House (of Ka'bah) a place of congregation and safe retreat, and said: ""Make the spot where Abraham stood the place of worship;"" and enjoined upon Abraham and Ishmael to keep Our House immaculate for those who shall walk around it and stay in it for contemplation and prayer, and for bowing in adoration."
ENAA133,QA133,ENAA,133,"And when Abraham said: ""O Lord, make this a city of peace, and give those of its citizens who believe in God and the Last Day fruits for food,"" He answered: ""To those will I also give a little who believe not, for a time, then drag them to Hell, a dreadful destination!"""
ENAA134,QA134,ENAA,134,"And when Abraham was raising the plinth of the House with Ishmael, (he prayed): ""Accept this from us, O Lord, for You hear and know everything;"
ENAA135,QA135,ENAA,135,"And make us submit, O Lord, to Your will, and our progeny a people submissive to You. Teach us the way of worship and forgive our trespasses, for You are compassionate and merciful;"
ENAA136,QA136,ENAA,136,"And send to them, O Lord, an apostle from among them to impart Your messages to them, and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and correct them in every way; for indeed You are mighty and wise."
ENAA137,QA137,ENAA,137,"Who will turn away from the creed of Abraham but one dull of soul? We made him the chosen one here in the world, and one of the best in the world to come,"
ENAA138,QA138,ENAA,138,"(For) when his Lord said to him: ""Obey,"" he replied: ""I submit to the Lord of all the worlds."""
ENAA139,QA139,ENAA,139,"And Abraham left this legacy to his sons, and to Jacob, and said: ""O my sons, God has chosen this as the faith for you. Do not die but as those who have submitted (to God)."""
ENAA140,QA140,ENAA,140,"Were you present at the hour of Jacob's death? ""What will you worship after me?"" he asked his sons, and they answered: ""We shall worship your God and the God of your fathers, of Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, the one and only God; and to Him we submit."""
ENAA141,QA141,ENAA,141,"Those were the people, and they have passed away. Theirs the reward for what they did, as yours will be for what you do. You will not be questioned about their deeds."

ENAA150,QA150,ENAA,150,"We have made you a temperate people that you act as witness over man, and the Prophet as witness over you. We decreed the Qiblah which you faced before that We may know who follow the Apostle and who turn away in haste. And this was a hard (test) except for those who were guided by God. But God will not suffer your faith to go waste, for God is to men full of mercy and grace."
ENAA151,QA151,ENAA,151,"We have seen you turn your face to the heavens. We shall turn you to a Qiblah that will please you. So turn towards the Holy Mosque, and turn towards it wherever you be.

ENAA165,QA165,ENAA,165,"Truly Safa and Marwa are the symbols of God. Whoever goes on pilgrimage to the House (of God), or on a holy visit, is not guilty of wrong if he walk around them; and he who does good of his own accord will find appreciation with God who knows everything."
ENAA166,QA166,ENAA,166,"They who conceal Our signs and the guidance We have sent them and have made clear in the Book, are condemned of God and are condemned by those who are worthy of condemning."

But he who is pardoned some of it by his brother should be dealt with equity, and recompense (for blood) paid with a grace. This is a concession from your Lord and a kindness. He who transgresses in spite of it shall suffer painful punishment."

ENAA187,QA187,ENAA,187,"It is ordained that when any one of you nears death, and he owns goods and chattels, he should bequeath them equitably to his parents and next of kin. This is binding on those who are upright and fear God."

For the good they do with a little hardship is better for men. And if you fast it is good for you, if you knew."
ENAA192,QA192,ENAA,192,"Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance, and criterion (of falsehood and truth). So when you see the new moon you should fast the whole month; but a person who is ill or travelling (and fails to do so) should fast on other days, as God wishes ease and not hardship for you, so that you complete the (fixed) number (of fasts), and give glory to God for the guidance, and be grateful."

ENAA194,QA194,ENAA,194,"You are allowed to sleep with your wives on the nights of the fast: They are your dress as you are theirs. God is aware you were cheating yourselves, so He turned to you and pardoned you. So now you may have intercourse with them, and seek what God has ordained for you. Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears clear from the dark line, then fast until the night falls; and abstain from your wives (when you have decided) to stay in the mosques for assiduous devotion. These are the bounds fixed by God, so keep well within them. So does God make His signs clear to men that they may take heed for themselves."

ENAA198,QA198,ENAA,198,"And fight those (who fight you) wheresoever you find them, and expel them from the place they had turned you out from. Oppression is worse than killing.

ENAA201,QA201,ENAA,201,"(Fighting during) the holy month (if the sanctity) of the holy month (is violated) is (just) retribution. So if you are oppressed, oppress those who oppress you to the same degree, and fear God, and know that God is with those who are pious and follow the right path."
ENAA202,QA202,ENAA,202,"Spend in the way of God, and do not seek destruction at your own hands. So do good for God loves those who do good."

But if you are prevented, send an offering which you can afford as sacrifice, and do not shave your heads until the offering has reached the place of sacrifice. But if you are sick or have ailment of the scalp (preventing the shaving of hair), then offer expiation by fasting or else giving alms or a sacrificial offering. When you have security, then those of you who wish to perform the holy visit along with the pilgrimage, should make a sacrifice according to their means. But he who has nothing, should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and seven on return, completing ten. This applies to him whose family does not live near the Holy Mosque. Have fear of God, and remember that God is severe in punishment."
ENAA204,QA204,ENAA,204,"Known are the months of pilgrimage. If one resolves to perform the pilgrimage in these months, let him not indulge in concupiscence, sin or quarrel. And the good you do shall be known to God. Provide for the journey, and the best of provisions is piety. O men of understanding, obey Me."
ENAA205,QA205,ENAA,205,"It is no sin to seek the favours of your Lord (by trading). When you start from 'Arafat in a concourse, remember God at the monument that is sacred (al-Mash'ar al-haram), and remember Him as He has shown you the way, for in the olden days you we're a people astray."
ENAA206,QA206,ENAA,206,"Then move with the crowd impetuously, and pray God to forgive you your sins. God is surely forgiving and kind."
ENAA207,QA207,ENAA,207,"When you have finished the rites and ceremonies, remember God as you do your fathers, in fact with a greater devotion. There are some who say: ""Give us, O Lord, in the world;"" but they will forego their share in the life to come."
ENAA208,QA208,ENAA,208,"But some there are who pray: ""Give us of good in the world, O Lord, and give us of good in the life to come, and suffer us not to suffer the torment of Hell."""
ENAA209,QA209,ENAA,209,They are those who will surely have their share of whatsoever they have earned; for God is swift at the reckoning.
ENAA210,QA210,ENAA,210,"Remember God during the stated days; but if a person comes away after two days, it will not be a sin; and if one tarries, he will not transgress, if he keep away from evil. Follow the law of God, and remember that you will have to gather before Him in the end."
ENAA211,QA211,ENAA,211,"There is a man who talks well of the world to your pleasing, and makes God witness to what is in his heart, yet he is the most contentious;"
ENAA212,QA212,ENAA,212,"For when his back is turned he goes about spreading disorder in the land, destroying fields and flocks; but God does not love disorder."
ENAA213,QA213,ENAA,213,"Whenever he is told: ""Obey God,"" his arrogance leads him to more sin; and sufficient for him shall be Hell: How evil a place of wide expanse!"

ENAA219,QA219,ENAA,219,"Enamoured are the unbelievers of the life of this world, and scoff at the faithful. But those who keep from evil and follow the straight path will have a higher place than they on the Day of Reckoning; for God gives in measure without number whomsoever He will."
ENAA220,QA220,ENAA,220,"Men belonged to a single community, and God sent them messengers to give them happy tidings and warnings, and sent the Book with them containing the truth to judge between them in matters of dispute; but only those who received it differed after receiving clear proofs, on account of waywardness (and jealousies) among them. Then God by His dispensation showed those who believed the way to the truth about which they were differing; for God shows whom He please the path that is straight."
ENAA221,QA221,ENAA,221,"Do you think you will find your way to Paradise even though you have not known what the others before you have gone through? They had suffered affliction and loss, and were shaken and tossed about so that even the Apostle had to cry out with his followers: ""When will the help of God arrive?"" Remember, the help of God is ever at hand."
ENAA222,QA222,ENAA,222,"They ask you of what they should give in charity. Tell them: ""What you can spare of your wealth as should benefit the parents, the relatives, the orphans, the needy, the wayfarers, for God is not unaware of the good deeds that you do."""

ENAA224,QA224,ENAA,224,"They ask you of war in the holy month. Tell them: ""To fight in that month is a great sin. But a greater sin in the eyes of God is to hinder people from the way of God, and not to believe in Him, and to bar access to the Holy Mosque and turn people out of its precincts; and oppression is worse than killing. They will always seek war against you till they turn you away from your faith, if they can. But those of you who turn back on their faith and die disbelieving will have wasted their deeds in this world and the next. They are inmates of Hell, and shall there abide for ever."
ENAA225,QA225,ENAA,225,"Surely those who believe, and those who leave their homes and fight in the way of God, may hope for His benevolence, for God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA226,QA226,ENAA,226,"They ask you of (intoxicants,) wine and gambling. Tell them: ""There is great enervation though profit in them for men; but their enervation is greater than benefit.

Tell them: ""Improving their lot is much better; and if you take interest in their affairs, they are your brethren; and God is aware who are corrupt and who are honest; and if He had pleased He could surely have imposed on you hardship, for God is all-powerful and all-wise."
ENAA228,QA228,ENAA,228,"Do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith. A maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her. And do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they accept the faith. A servant who is a believer is better than an idolater even though you may like him. They invite you to Hell, but God calls you to Paradise and pardon by His grace. And He makes His signs manifest that men may haply take heed."
ENAA229,QA229,ENAA,229,"They ask you about menstruation. Tell them: ""This is a period of stress. So keep away from women in this state till they are relieved of it. When they are free of it, you may go to them as God has enjoined. For God loves those who seek pardon, and those who are clean."""
ENAA230,QA230,ENAA,230,"Women are like fields for you; so seed them as you intend, but plan the future in advance. And fear God, and remember, you have to face Him in the end. So convey glad tidings to those who believe."

ENAA232,QA232,ENAA,232,"God will not call you to account for that which is senseless in your oaths, but only for what is in your hearts; for God is forgiving and forbearing."
ENAA233,QA233,ENAA,233,"Those who swear to keep away from their wives (with intent of divorcing them) have four months of grace; then if they reconcile (during this period), surely God is forgiving and kind."

ENAA235,QA235,ENAA,235,"Women who are divorced have to wait for three monthly periods, and if they believe in God and the Last Day they must not hide unlawfully what God has formed within their wombs. Their husbands would do well to take them back in that case, if they wish to be reconciled. Women also have recognised rights as men have, though men have an edge over them. But God is all-mighty and all-wise."
ENAA236,QA236,ENAA,236,"Divorce is (revokable) two times (after pronouncement), after which (there are two ways open for husbands), either (to) keep (the wives) honourably, or part with them in a decent way. You are not allowed to take away the least of what you have given your wives, unless both of you fear that you would not be able to keep within the limits set by God. If you fear you cannot maintain the bounds fixed by God, there will be no blame on either if the woman redeems herself. Do not exceed the limits of God, for those who exceed the bounds set by God are transgressors."
ENAA237,QA237,ENAA,237,"If a man divorces her again (a third time), she becomes unlawful for him (and he cannot remarry her) until she has married another man.

ENAA238,QA238,ENAA,238,"When you have divorced your wives, and they have reached the end of the period of waiting, then keep them honourably (by revoking the divorce), or let them go with honour, and do not detain them with the intent of harassing lest you should transgress. He who does so will wrong himself. Do not mock the decrees of God, and remember the favours God has bestowed on you, and revealed to you the Book and the Law to warn you of the consequences of doing wrong. Have fear of God, and remember, God is cognisant of everything."
ENAA239,QA239,ENAA,239,"When you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term (of waiting), do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably. This warning is for those among you who believe in God and the Last Day. This is both proper and right for you, for God knows and you do not know."
ENAA240,QA240,ENAA,240,"The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling, in which case they should feed them and clothe them in a befitting way; but no soul should be compelled beyond capacity, neither the mother made to suffer for the child nor the father for his offspring. The same holds good for the heir of the father (if he dies). If they wish to wean the child by mutual consent there is no harm. And if you wish to engage a wet nurse you may do so if you pay her an agreed amount as is customary. But fear God, and remember that God sees all that you do."
ENAA241,QA241,ENAA,241,"Wives of men who die among you should wait (after their husbands death) for four months and ten days; and when the term is over there is no sin if they do what they like with themselves honourably, for God is aware of all that you do."
ENAA242,QA242,ENAA,242,"There is no harm in proposing in secret to (any of) these women, or keeping the intention to yourself: God is aware that you will keep them in mind. Yet do not make a promise in secret, unless you speak in a manner that is proper; and do not resolve upon marriage till the fixed term of waiting is over. Remember that God knows what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him, and remember that God is forgiving and forbearing."
ENAA243,QA243,ENAA,243,"There is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry; but then provide adequately for them, the affluent according to their means, the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting. This is surely the duty of those who do good."
ENAA244,QA244,ENAA,244,"And if you divorce them before the consummation of marriage, but after settling the dowry, then half the settled dowry must be paid, unless the woman forgoes it, or the person who holds the bond of marriage pays the full amount. And if the man pays the whole, it is nearer to piety. But do not forget to be good to each other, and remember that God sees all that you do."
ENAA245,QA245,ENAA,245,"Be wakeful of your service of prayer, and the midmost service; and honour God by standing before Him in devotion."
ENAA246,QA246,ENAA,246,"If you fear (war or danger), pray while standing or on horseback; but when you have safety again remember God, for He taught you what you did not know."
ENAA247,QA247,ENAA,247,"Those among you about to die leaving wives behind, should bequeath a year's maintenance and lodging for them, without expelling them from home. But if they leave (of their own accord), you will not be blamed for what they do with themselves in their own rights. God is all-mighty and all-wise."
ENAA248,QA248,ENAA,248,Making a fair provision for women who are divorced is the duty of those who are God-fearing and pious.
ENAA249,QA249,ENAA,249,So does God pronounce His decrees that you may understand.
ENAA250,QA250,ENAA,250,"Have you never thought of men who went out of their homes as a measure of safety against death, and they were thousands, to whom God said: ""Die,"" then restored them to life? Indeed God bestows His blessings on men; only most men are not grateful."
ENAA251,QA251,ENAA,251,"Fight in the way of God, and remember that God hears all and knows everything."
ENAA252,QA252,ENAA,252,"Who will give a goodly loan to God which He might double many times? For God withholds and enlarges, and to Him you will return."
ENAA253,QA253,ENAA,253,"Have you thought of the elders of Israel after Moses, and how they said to their apostle: ""Set up a king for us, then we shall fight in the way of God?"" He replied: ""This too is possible that when commanded to fight you may not fight at all."" They said: ""How is it we should not fight in the way of God when we have been driven from our homes and deprived of our Sons?"" But when they were ordered to fight they turned away, except for a few; yet God knows the sinners."
ENAA254,QA254,ENAA,254,"And when their prophet said to them: ""God has raised Saul king over you,"" they said: ""How can he be king over us when we have greater right to kingship than he, for he does not even possess abundant wealth?"" ""God has chosen him in preference to you,"" said the prophet ""and given him much more wisdom and prowess; and God gives authority to whomsoever He will: God is infinite and all-wise."""
ENAA255,QA255,ENAA,255,"Their prophet said to them: ""The sign of his kingship will be that you will come to have a heart full of peace and tranquility from your Lord and the legacy left by Moses' and Aaron's family supported by angels. This shall be a token for you if you really believe."""
ENAA256,QA256,ENAA,256,"When Saul led his armies, he said: ""God will test you by a stream. Whoever drinks its water will not be of me; but those who do not drink shall be on my side. The only exception will be those who scoop up a palmful of water with their hands."" And but for a few they all drank of its water. When they had crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said: ""We have no strength to combat Goliath and his forces today. But those who believed they have to face their Lord, said: ""Many a time has a small band defeated a large horde by the will of God. God is with those who are patient (and persevere)."""
ENAA257,QA257,ENAA,257,"And when they were facing Goliath and his hordes they prayed: ""O Lord, give us endurance and steady our steps, and help us against the deniers of truth."""
ENAA258,QA258,ENAA,258,"By the will of God they defeated them, and David killed Goliath, and God gave him kingship and wisdom, and taught him whatsoever He pleased. If God did not make men deter one another this earth would indeed be depraved. But gracious is God to the people of the world."
ENAA259,QA259,ENAA,259,"These are the messages of God. We recite them to you in all truth, as indeed you are one of the apostles."
ENAA260,QA260,ENAA,260,"Of all these apostles We have favoured some over the others. God has addressed some of them, and the stations of some have been exalted over the others. And to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave tokens, and reinforced him with divine grace. If God had so willed those who came after them would never have contended when clear signs had come to them. But dissensions arose, some believed, some denied. And if God had willed they would never have fought among themselves. But God does whatsoever He please."
ENAA261,QA261,ENAA,261,"O believers, expend of what We have given you before the day arrives on which there will be no barter, and no friendship or intercession matter, and those who are disbelievers will be sinners."
ENAA262,QA262,ENAA,262,"God: There is no god but He, the living, eternal, self-subsisting, ever sustaining. Neither does somnolence affect Him nor sleep. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth: and who can intercede with Him except by His leave? Known to Him is all that is present before men and what is hidden (in time past and time future), and not even a little of His knowledge can they grasp except what He will. His seat extends over heavens and the earth, and He tires not protecting them: He alone is all high and supreme."
ENAA263,QA263,ENAA,263,"There is no compulsion in matter of faith. Distinct is the way of guidance now from error. He who turns away from the forces of evil and believes in God, will surely hold fast to a handle that is strong and unbreakable, for God hears all and knows everything."
ENAA264,QA264,ENAA,264,"God is the friend of those who believe, and leads them out of darkness into light; but the patrons of infidels are idols and devils who lead them from light into darkness. They are the residents of Hell, and will there for ever abide."
ENAA265,QA265,ENAA,265,"Have you thought of the man who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him a kingdom? When Abraham said: ""My Lord is the giver of life and death,"" he replied: ""I am the giver of life and death."" And Abraham said: ""God makes the sun rise from the East; so you make it rise from the West,"" and dumbfounded was the infidel. God does not guide those who are unjust."
ENAA266,QA266,ENAA,266,"Or take the man who passed by a town which lay destroyed upside down. He said: ""How can God restore this city now that it is destroyed?"" So God made him die for a hundred years, then brought him back to life, and inquired: ""How long did you stay in this state?"" ""A day or less than a day,"" he replied. ""No,"" He said, ""you were dead a hundred years, yet look at your victuals, they have not decomposed; and look at your ass! We shall make you a warning for men. And regard the bones, how We raise them and clothe them with flesh."" When this became clear to him, the man said: ""Indeed God has power over all things."""
ENAA267,QA267,ENAA,267,"Remember, when Abraham said: ""O Lord, show me how you raise the dead,"" He said: ""What! Do you not believe?"" ""I do,"" answered Abraham. ""I only ask for my heart's assurance."" (The Lord) said: ""Trap four birds and tame them, then put each of them on a (separate) hill, and call them, and they will come flying to you. Know that God is all-powerful and all-wise."""
ENAA268,QA268,ENAA,268,"The semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears, each ear containing a hundred grains. Truly God increases for whomsoever He will, for God is infinite and all-wise."
ENAA269,QA269,ENAA,269,"Those who spend in the way of God, and having spent do not boast or give pain (by word or deed), will get their reward from their Lord, and will neither have fear nor regret."
ENAA270,QA270,ENAA,270,"Saying a word that is kind, and forgiving is better than charity that hurts. (Do not forget that) God is affluent and kind."
ENAA271,QA271,ENAA,271,"O believers, do not nullify your charity by giving to oblige and flaunting (your favours) like a man who spends of his wealth only to show off, but does not believe in God and the Last Day. His semblance is that of a rock covered with earth which is washed away by rain exposing the hard rock bare. So they gain nothing from their earnings. God does not guide a people who do not believe."
ENAA272,QA272,ENAA,272,"But the semblance of those who expend their wealth to please God with firm and resolute hearts, is like a garden on a height on which the rain falls and it yields its fruits twice as much; and even if the rain does not fall the dew will suffice. For God sees all that you do."
ENAA273,QA273,ENAA,273,"Does any of you wish to have an orchard full of date-palm trees and vines, and streams of running water and fruits of all kinds, and then old age should overtake him while his children are small, and a scorching whirlwind should smite and burn it down? Thus God makes His signs clear to you that you may reflect."
ENAA274,QA274,ENAA,274,"O believers, give in charity what is good of the things you have earned, and of what you produce from the earth; and do not choose to give what is bad as alms, that is, things you would not like to accept yourself except with some condescension. Remember that God is affluent and praiseworthy."
ENAA275,QA275,ENAA,275,"Satan threatens you with want, and orders you (to commit) shameful acts. But God promises His pardon and grace, for God is bounteous and all-knowing."
ENAA276,QA276,ENAA,276,He gives wisdom to whomsoever He please; and those who are bestowed wisdom get good in abundance. Yet none remembers this save men of wisdom.
ENAA277,QA277,ENAA,277,"Whatsoever you give away in alms or vow as offering, is all known to God; but the wicked will have none to help them."
ENAA278,QA278,ENAA,278,"If you give alms openly, it is well; but if you do it secretly and give to the poor, that is better. This will absolve you of some of your sins; and God is cognisant of all you do."
ENAA279,QA279,ENAA,279,"It is not for you to guide them: God guides whom He will. Whatever you spend you will do so for yourself, for you will do so to seek the way that leads to God; and what you spend in charity you will get back in full, and no wrong will be done to you."
ENAA280,QA280,ENAA,280,"(Give to) the needy who are engaged in the service of God who are not able to move about in the land, whom the ignorant consider to be affluent as they refrain from asking. You can know them from their faces for they do not ask of men importunately. God is surely cognisant of good things that you spend."
ENAA281,QA281,ENAA,281,"Those who spend of their wealth in the way of God, day and night, in secret or openly, have their reward with their Lord, and have nothing to fear or regret."
ENAA282,QA282,ENAA,282,"Those who live on usury will not rise (on Doomsday) but like a man possessed of the devil and demented. This because they say that trading is like usury. But trade has been sanctioned and usury forbidden by God. Those who are warned by their Lord and desist will keep (what they have taken of interest) already, and the matter will rest with God. But those who revert to it again are the residents of Hell where they will abide for ever."
ENAA283,QA283,ENAA,283,"God takes away (gain) from usury, but adds (profit) to charity; and God does not love the ungrateful and sinners."
ENAA284,QA284,ENAA,284,"Those who believe and do good deeds, and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, have their reward with their Lord, and will have neither fear nor regret."
ENAA285,QA285,ENAA,285,"O believers, fear God and forego the interest that is owing, if you really believe."
ENAA286,QA286,ENAA,286,"If you do not, beware of war on the part of God and His Apostle. But if you repent, you shall keep your principal. Oppress none and no one will oppress you."
ENAA287,QA287,ENAA,287,"If a debtor is in want, give him time until his circumstances improve; but if you forego (the debt) as charity, that will be to your good, if you really understand."
ENAA288,QA288,ENAA,288,"Have fear of the day when you go back to God. Then each will be paid back in full his reward, and no one will be wronged."
ENAA289,QA289,ENAA,289,"O believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing, though better it would be to have a scribe write it faithfully down; and no scribe should refuse to write as God has taught him, and write what the borrower dictates, and have fear of God, his Lord, and not leave out a thing. If the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm, or unable to explain, let the guardian explain judiciously; and have two of your men to act as witnesses; but if two men are not available, then a man and two women you approve, so that in case one of them is confused the other may prompt her. When the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse (to come). But do not neglect to draw up a contract, big or small, with the time fixed for paying back the debt. This is more equitable in the eyes of God, and better as evidence and best for avoiding doubt. But if it is a deal about some merchandise requiring transaction face to face, there is no harm if no (contract is drawn up) in writing. Have witnesses to the deal, (and make sure) that the scribe or the witness is not harmed. If he is, it would surely be sinful on your part. And have fear of God, for God gives you knowledge, and God is aware of everything."
ENAA290,QA290,ENAA,290,"If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, pledge your goods (against the Loan); and if one trusts the other, then let him who is trusted deliver the thing entrusted, and have fear of God, his Lord. Do not suppress any evidence, for he who conceals evidence is sinful of heart; and God is aware of all you do."
ENAA291,QA291,ENAA,291,"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; and whether you reveal what is in your heart or conceal it, you will have to account for it to God who will pardon whom He please and punish whom He will, for God has the power over all things."
ENAA292,QA292,ENAA,292,"The Prophet believes in what has been revealed to him by his Lord, and so do the faithful. Each one believes in God and His angels, His Books and the prophets, and We make no distinction between the apostles.

ENAA293,QA293,ENAA,293,"God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. Each will enjoy what (good) he earns, as indeed each will suffer from (the wrong) he does. Punish us not, O Lord, if we fail to remember or lapse into error. Burden us not, O Lord, with a burden as You did those before us. Impose not upon us a burden, O Lord, we cannot carry.

Some of you desired this world, and some of you the next. Then He put you to flight before (them) in order to try you. But (now) He has forgiven you, for surely God is kind to the faithful."
ENAA446,QA446,ENAA,446,"Remember, as you were rushing up (the hill) without turning back to look, though the Prophet was calling you from the rear, He requited you with anguish for an anguish that you do not fret for missed opportunity and what befell you, for God is aware of all that you do,"
ENAA447,QA447,ENAA,447,"Then after affliction He Sent you a drowsiness as comes after security, overwhelming some among you, and making some anxious for themselves, and made them think thoughts of pagan ignorance; and they said: ""Have we a say in any affair?""

Tell them: ""Even had you stayed at home, those of you who were ordained to fight would have gone to their place of (eternal) rest.

ENAA452,QA452,ENAA,452,"It was through God's mercy that you dealt with them gently; for had you been stern and hard of heart they would surely have broken away from you.

ENAA453,QA453,ENAA,453,"If God is there to help you none will overcome you; and if He forsake you, who will help you other than Him? So only in God should the faithful place their trust."

ENAA458,QA458,ENAA,458,"How is it that when misfortune befell you, you said: ""Where has this come from?"" -- even though you had inflicted disaster twice as great on (the enemy). Say: ""This has come from your own selves."" Surely God has power over all things."
ENAA459,QA459,ENAA,459,"What you suffered on the day the two armies had met was by God's dispensation, so that He may distinguish the faithful,"

ENAA493,QA493,ENAA,493,"So you who believe, have endurance in suffering, be patient and persevere, strengthen each other and be firm, and be pious and fear God that you may find success."
ENAA494,QA494,ENAA,494,"O MEN, FEAR your Lord who created you from a single cell, and from it created its mate, and from the two of them dispersed men and women (male and female) in multitudes. So fear God in whose name you ask of one another (the bond of) relationships. God surely keeps watch over you."
ENAA495,QA495,ENAA,495,"Give to the orphans their possessions, and do not replace things of your own which are bad with things which are good among theirs, and do not intermix their goods with your own and make use of them, for this is a grievous crime."
ENAA496,QA496,ENAA,496,"If you fear you cannot be equitable to orphan girls (in your charge, or misuse their persons), then marry women who are lawful for you, two, three, or four; but if you fear you cannot treat so many with equity, marry only one, or a maid or captive. This is better than being iniquitous."
ENAA497,QA497,ENAA,497,"Give to women their dowers willingly, but if they forego part of it themselves, then use it to your advantage."
ENAA498,QA498,ENAA,498,"Do not entrust (their) property God has given you to maintain (On trust), to those who are immature; but feed them and clothe them from it, and speak to them with kindness."
ENAA499,QA499,ENAA,499,"And test (and try) the orphans until they are of marriageable age. If you find they have acquired sound judgement, then hand over their property to them; but devour not their wealth, nor use it up hastily out of fear that soon they will grow up (and demand it). And (the guardian) who is rich should abstain from spending much (of their wealth); and he who is poor should use only as much as is fair. And when you give back their possessions have this witnessed, (and remember) that God is sufficient to take all account."
ENAA500,QA500,ENAA,500,Men have a share in what the parents and relatives leave behind at death; and women have a share in what the parents and relatives leave behind. Be it large or small a legal share is fixed.
ENAA501,QA501,ENAA,501,"And when the relatives and orphans and the needy collect at the time of the division (of property) provide for them too, and talk kindly to them."
ENAA502,QA502,ENAA,502,"Let people fear the day when they leave small children behind them unprovided, and how concerned they would be for them. So fear God and say the right things to them."
ENAA503,QA503,ENAA,503,"Those who devour the possessions of the orphans unjustly devour only fire, and will surely burn in Hell."
ENAA504,QA504,ENAA,504,"As for the children, God decrees that the share of the male is equivalent to that of two females. If they consist of women only, and of them more than two, they will get two-thirds of the inheritance; but in case there is one, she will inherit one half. The parents will each inherit a sixth of the estate if it happens the deceased has left a child; but if he has left no children, and his parents are his heirs, then the mother will inherit one-third; but if he has left brothers, the mother will inherit one-sixth after payment of legacies and debts. Of parents and children you do not know who are more useful to you. These are the decrees of God who knows all and is wise."
ENAA505,QA505,ENAA,505,"Your share in the property the wives leave behind is half if they die without an issue, but in case they have left children, then your share is one-fourth after the payment of legacies and debts; and your wife shall inherit one-fourth of what you leave at death if you die childless, if not, she will get one-eighth of what you leave behind after payment of legacies and debts. If a man or a woman should die without leaving either children or parents behind but have brother and sister, they shall each inherit one-sixth. In case there are more, they will share one-third of the estate after payment of legacies and debts without prejudice to others. This is the decree of God who knows all and is kind."
ENAA506,QA506,ENAA,506,"These are the limits set by God, and those who follow the commandments of God and the Prophet, will indeed be admitted to gardens with streams of water running by, where they will for ever abide; and this will be success supreme."
ENAA507,QA507,ENAA,507,"Those who disobey God and the Prophet and exceed the bounds of law, will be taken to Hell and abide there for ever and shall suffer despicable punishment."
ENAA508,QA508,ENAA,508,"If any of your women is guilty of unnatural offence, bring four of your witnesses to give evidence; if they testify against them, retain them in the houses until death overtakes them or God provides some other way for them."
ENAA509,QA509,ENAA,509,"If two (men) among you are guilty of such acts then punish both of them. But if they repent and reform, let them be, for God accepts repentance and is merciful."
ENAA510,QA510,ENAA,510,"God does accept repentance, but only of those who are guilty of an evil out of ignorance yet quickly repent, and God turns to them again, for God is all-knowing and all-wise."
ENAA511,QA511,ENAA,511,"But (He does not accept) the repentance of those who continue indulging in evil until death draws near and they say: ""We now repent;"" nor of those who die disbelieving. For them We have a grievous retribution in wait."
ENAA512,QA512,ENAA,512,"O believers, you are not allowed to take perforce the women (of dead relatives) into your heritage, or tyrannise over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them, unless they are guilty of open adultery. Live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them. For it may well be you may not like a thing, yet God may have endued it with much goodness."
ENAA513,QA513,ENAA,513,"If you want to take another wife in place of the one you are married to, then even if you have given her a talent of gold, do not take back a thing. Would you take it away by slandering and using unjust means?"
ENAA514,QA514,ENAA,514,"How could you do that having slept with one another, and when they had taken a solemn pledge from you?"
ENAA515,QA515,ENAA,515,"And do not wed the women your fathers had wed. What happened in the past is now past: It was lewd and abhorrent, and only the way of evil."
ENAA516,QA516,ENAA,516,"Unlawful are your mothers and daughters and your sisters to you, and the sisters of your fathers and your mothers, and the daughters of your brothers and sisters, and foster mothers, foster sisters, and the mothers of your wives, and the daughters of the wives you have slept with who are under your charge; but in case you have not slept with them there is no offence (if you marry their daughters); and the wives of your own begotten sons; and marrying two sisters is unlawful. What happened in the past (is now past): God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA517,QA517,ENAA,517,"Also forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war). Such is the decree of God. Lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery. Then give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower. It will not be sinful if you agree to something (else) by mutual consent after having settled the dowry. God is certainly all-knowing and all-wise."
ENAA518,QA518,ENAA,518,"If one of you cannot afford to marry a believing gentlewoman (let him marry) a maid who is a believer. God is aware of your faith: The one of you is of the other; so marry them with the consent of their people, and give them an appropriate dowry. They are women (seeking) wedlock, and not lechery, nor secretly looking for paramours. But if they are married and guilty of adultery, inflict on them half the punishment (enjoined) for gentlewomen. This is for those who are afraid of doing wrong. In case they can wait, it is better for them. God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA519,QA519,ENAA,519,"God wishes to make it clear to you and guide you through the example of earlier people, and to forgive you, for God is all-knowing and all-wise."
ENAA520,QA520,ENAA,520,"God likes to turn to you, but those who are lost in the pleasures of the flesh wish to turn you astray, far away."
ENAA521,QA521,ENAA,521,"God would like to lighten your burden, for man was created weak."
ENAA522,QA522,ENAA,522,"O believers, you should not usurp unjustly the wealth of each other, but trade by mutual consent; and do not destroy yourselves. God is merciful to you."
ENAA523,QA523,ENAA,523,"If someone does so through oppression or injustice, We shall cast him into Hell: This is how (the Law of) God works inevitably."
ENAA524,QA524,ENAA,524,"If you keep away from the deadly sins that have been forbidden, We shall efface your faults, and lead you to a place of honour."
ENAA525,QA525,ENAA,525,"Do not covet what God has favoured some with more than He has some others. Men have a share in what they earn, and women have theirs in what they earn. Ask God for His favours. Surely God has knowledge of everything."
ENAA526,QA526,ENAA,526,"For each We have appointed heirs to what parents and relatives leave behind. And to those you have given your pledge in marriage give their share, for God is witness to everything."
ENAA527,QA527,ENAA,527,"Men are the support of women as God gives some more means than others, and because they spend of their wealth (to provide for them). So women who are virtuous are obedient to God and guard the hidden as God has guarded it. As for women you feel are averse, talk to them suasively; then leave them alone in bed (without molesting them) and go to bed with them (when they are willing). If they open out to you, do not seek an excuse for blaming them. Surely God is sublime and great."
ENAA528,QA528,ENAA,528,"If you fear a breach between them, appoint one arbiter from the people of the man and one from the people of the woman. If they wish to have a settlement then God will reconcile them, for God is all-knowing and cognisant."
ENAA529,QA529,ENAA,529,"Pay homage to God, and make none His compeer, and be good to your parents and relatives, the orphans and the needy and the neighbours who are your relatives, and the neighbours who are strangers, and the friend by your side, the traveller and your servants and subordinates. God does not surely love those who are arrogant and boastful,"
ENAA530,QA530,ENAA,530,"Who are miserly and bid others to be so, and hide what God has given them in His largesse. We have prepared for unbelievers a shameful punishment."
ENAA531,QA531,ENAA,531,"Those who spend of their wealth to show off and do not believe in God and the Last Day, take Satan as companion, and how evil a companion (have they)!"
ENAA532,QA532,ENAA,532,"Would something have befallen them if they had believed in God and the Last Day, and spent of what has been given them by God? God is fully aware of all they do."
ENAA533,QA533,ENAA,533,"God does not wrong any one, not even the equal of an atom; and if men do good He multiplies it by two, and adds a great reward of His own."
ENAA534,QA534,ENAA,534,How shall it be when We call witnesses from each and every people and call you as witness over them?
ENAA535,QA535,ENAA,535,"On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Prophet, shall wish they were levelled with the dust, and shall not be able to conceal a thing from God."
ENAA536,QA536,ENAA,536,"O you who believe, do not perform your service of prayer when you are intoxicated until you are sure of what you are saying, nor when in a state of seminal pollution, until you have taken a bath, except when you are travelling. But in case you are ill or are travelling, or you have relieved yourself of nature's call, or cohabited with a woman, and cannot find water, then take wholesome dust and pass it over your face and hands: God is benign and forgiving."
ENAA537,QA537,ENAA,537,"Have you not seen the people who were given a share of the Book, but who purchased only error, and wish that you also go astray?"
ENAA538,QA538,ENAA,538,"But God knows your enemies well: and sufficient is God to protect you, and sufficient is God for all help."
ENAA539,QA539,ENAA,539,"Some among the Jews distort the words out of context and say (in place of the right words): ""We have heard and do not obey;"" and, ""hear without hearing,"" and ""listen to us,"" twisting their tongues and reviling the faith. But if they had said: ""We have heard and obey,"" and, ""hear and regard us,"" it would have been better for them and more appropriate. But God has disgraced them for their lack of belief; and so only a few of them believe."
ENAA540,QA540,ENAA,540,"O people of the Book, believe in what We have revealed, which confirms what is already with you before We disfigure your visages and turn your faces about and curse you, as We did with those who had broken the Sabbath; and what God decrees comes to pass."
ENAA541,QA541,ENAA,541,"God does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to Him, though He may forgive aught else if He please. And he who ascribes compeers to God is guilty of the gravest sin."
ENAA542,QA542,ENAA,542,"Have you not seen the people who call themselves pure? Yet God purifies whom He pleases, and none shall be wronged even the breadth of a thread."
ENAA543,QA543,ENAA,543,"See how they fabricate lies about God, which is a clear sin."
ENAA544,QA544,ENAA,544,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book, who believe in false deities and evil powers, and say of unbelievers: ""These are better guided than those who believe."""
ENAA545,QA545,ENAA,545,They are the ones who were cursed by God; and those who are cursed by God will have none to protect them.
ENAA546,QA546,ENAA,546,"Have they a share in the kingdom? (If they had,) they would never have given an iota to the people."
ENAA547,QA547,ENAA,547,"Are they so envious of others for what God has given them of His bounty? So We had given the Book and the Law to Abraham's family, and given them great dominion."
ENAA548,QA548,ENAA,548,"Then some of them believed in it, and some turned away from it; yet sufficient is Hell, the flaming Fire!"
ENAA549,QA549,ENAA,549,"And those who disbelieve Our revelations shall be cast into Hell; and when their skin is burnt up and singed, We shall give them a new coat that they may go on tasting the agony of punishment, for God is all-mighty and all-wise."
ENAA550,QA550,ENAA,550,"But those who believe and do good deeds We shall admit into gardens with streams of running water, where they will abide for ever, with fairest of companions and coolest of shades."
ENAA551,QA551,ENAA,551,"God enjoins that you render to the owners what is held in trust with you, and that when you judge among the people do so equitably. Noble are the counsels of God, and God hears all and sees everything."
ENAA552,QA552,ENAA,552,"O you who believe, obey God and the Prophet and those in authority among you; and if you are at variance over something, refer it to God and the Messenger, if you believe in God and the Last Day. This is good for you and the best of settlement."
ENAA553,QA553,ENAA,553,"Have you never seen those who aver they believe in what has been revealed to you and had been to others before you, yet desire to turn for judgement to evil powers, even though they have been commanded to disbelieve in them? Satan only wishes to lead them astray, far away."
ENAA554,QA554,ENAA,554,"When they are told: ""Come to that which God has revealed, and to the Prophet,"" you should see the hypocrites, how they hesitate and turn their faces away."
ENAA555,QA555,ENAA,555,"How shall it be when they suffer misfortunes for their own misdeeds? Then they will come to you swearing by God and saying: ""We wish for nothing but good and amity."""
ENAA556,QA556,ENAA,556,"The secrets of the hearts of these people are well known to God. So leave them alone, and counsel them and speak to them eloquent words that would touch their very souls."
ENAA557,QA557,ENAA,557,"We have sent no apostle but that he should be obeyed by the will of God. If they had come to you after wronging themselves and asked forgiveness of God, and you had also asked forgiveness for them, they would surely have found God forgiving and merciful."
ENAA558,QA558,ENAA,558,"Indeed, by your Lord, they will not believe till they make you adjudge in their disputes and find no constraint in their minds about your decisions and accept them with full acquiescence."
ENAA559,QA559,ENAA,559,"If We had commanded them to lay down their lives and to go forth from their homes, only a few would have obeyed; though had they followed what they had been commanded it would surely have been good for them and the strengthening of their faith."
ENAA560,QA560,ENAA,560,"And We would have bestowed on them a great reward of Our own,"
ENAA561,QA561,ENAA,561,And led them to the path that is straight.
ENAA562,QA562,ENAA,562,"Those who obey God and the Prophet are with those who are blessed by God, the prophets, the sincere and the trustful, the martyrs and the upright; and how excellent a company are they!"
ENAA563,QA563,ENAA,563,"This is a favour from God; and sufficient is God, the all-knowing."
ENAA564,QA564,ENAA,564,"O believers, take precautions, and advance in detachments, or go all together in a body."
ENAA565,QA565,ENAA,565,"Someone among you will surely lag behind, and if calamity should befall you, will say: ""God was gracious to me that I was not among them."""
ENAA566,QA566,ENAA,566,"But if success comes to you from God he will say, as though no love existed between you and him: ""I wish I were with them, for I would have certainly met with great success."""
ENAA567,QA567,ENAA,567,"Those who barter the life of this world for the next should fight in the way of God. And We shall bestow on him who fights in the way of God, whether he is killed or is victorious, a glorious reward."
ENAA568,QA568,ENAA,568,"What has come upon you that you fight not in the cause of God and for the oppressed, men, women and children, who pray: ""Get us out of this city, O Lord, whose people are oppressors; so send us a friend by Your will, and send us a helper."""
ENAA569,QA569,ENAA,569,"Those who believe fight in the way of God; and those who do not, only fight for the powers of evil; so you should fight the allies of Satan. Surely the stratagem of Satan is ineffective."
ENAA570,QA570,ENAA,570,"Have you not seen the people who were told: ""Hold back your hands (from attacking), observe your devotional obligations and pay the zakat?"" But when they were commanded to fight, behold, a section among them were filled with fear of men as though it were the fear of God and even more, and said: ""O Lord, why did you make war compulsory for us? Why did you not allow us to live a little more?"" Say to them: ""How short-lived is the commerce of this world; but that of the next is best for those who fear God; and you will not be wronged the breadth of a thread."""
ENAA571,QA571,ENAA,571,"Death will overtake you wheresoever you be, even in the mightiest of towers. Yet if some good comes their way they say: ""It is from God;"" and if it is evil that befalls them, they say: ""It is indeed from you."" Say to them: ""Every thing is from God."" O, what has come upon the people that even this they fail to understand!"
ENAA572,QA572,ENAA,572,What comes to you of good is verily from God; and what comes to you of ill is from your own self (your actions). We have sent you as apostle to all mankind; and God is sufficient as witness.
ENAA573,QA573,ENAA,573,He who obeys the Apostle obeys God; and if some turn away (remember) We have not sent you as warden over them.
ENAA574,QA574,ENAA,574,"They say: ""We obey;"" but when they leave your company, a section of them discuss at night other things than you had said; but God takes note of what they discuss. So turn aside from them and trust in God; and God is sufficient as protector."
ENAA575,QA575,ENAA,575,Do they not ponder over the Qur'an? Had it been the word of any other but God they would surely have found a good deal of variation in it.
ENAA576,QA576,ENAA,576,"And when any tidings of peace or war come to them they spread the news around. Had they gone to the Prophet or those in authority among them, then those who check and scrutinize would have known it, And but for the favour of God and His mercy you would certainly have followed Satan, except a few."
ENAA577,QA577,ENAA,577,"So fight on in the way of God (irrespective of the others). You cannot compel any one except your own self; but urge the believers to fight. It may well be that God will keep back the might of the infidels, for God's might is greater, and severe His punishment."
ENAA578,QA578,ENAA,578,He who intercedes in a good cause will surely have a share in the recompense; and he who abets an evil act will share the burden thereof; for God (equates and) is watchful of all things.
ENAA579,QA579,ENAA,579,"When you are greeted with a greeting, then greet with one fairer, or repeat the same greeting. For God takes account of all things."
ENAA580,QA580,ENAA,580,God: There is no god but He. He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection which is certain to come; and whose word is truer than God's?
ENAA581,QA581,ENAA,581,How is it that you are divided in two factions about the hypocrites? God has routed them for what they were doing. Do you wish to guide him to the path whom God has allowed to go astray? As for him whom God allows to go astray you will not find a way.
ENAA582,QA582,ENAA,582,"They wish you to become disbelievers as they are, so that you should become like them. Therefore hold them not as friends until they go out of their homes in the way of God. If they do not, seize them wherever they are and do away with them. Do not make them your friends or allies,"
ENAA583,QA583,ENAA,583,"Except those who take refuge with a people allied to you, or those who, weary of fighting you or their people, come over to you. If God had so willed He would surely have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. If they keep aloof and do not fight, and offer peace, God has left you no reason to fight them."
ENAA584,QA584,ENAA,584,"You will also find persons who, while wishing to live in peace with you as well as with their own people, turn to civil war the moment they are called to it. If they do not keep away from you, nor offer you peace nor restrain their hands, seize them and kill them wherever they are. We have given you a clear sanction against them."
ENAA585,QA585,ENAA,585,"It is not for a believer to take a believer's life except by mistake; and he who kills a believer by mistake should free a slave who is a believer, and pay blood-money to the victim's family unless they forego it as an act of charity. If he belonged to a community hostile to you but was himself a believer, then a slave who is a believer should be freed. In case he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, then give blood-money to his family and free a believing slave. But he who has no means (to do so) should fast for a period of two months continuously to have his sins forgiven by God, and God is all-knowing and all-wise."
ENAA586,QA586,ENAA,586,"Any one who kills a believer intentionally will be cast into Hell to abide there for ever, and suffer God's anger and damnation. For him a greater punishment awaits."
ENAA587,QA587,ENAA,587,"O believers, when you go out on a journey in the way of God, be discreet and do not say to anyone who greets you in peace: ""You are not a believer."" You desire the gain of earthly life, but there are prizes in plenty with God. You were also like him (an unbeliever) in the past, but God has been gracious to you. So be careful and discreet, for God is aware of what you do."
ENAA588,QA588,ENAA,588,"The faithful who sit idle, other than those who are disabled, are not equal to those who fight in the way of God with their wealth and lives. God has exalted those in rank who fight for the faith with their wealth and souls over those who sit idle. Though God's promise of good is for all, He has granted His favour of the highest reward to those who struggle in preference to those who sit at home."
ENAA589,QA589,ENAA,589,"For them are higher ranks with God, and forgiveness and grace; and God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA590,QA590,ENAA,590,"As for those whose souls are taken by the angels (at death) while in a state of unbelief, they will be asked by the angels: ""What (state) were you in?"" They will answer: ""We were oppressed in the land."" And the angels will say: ""Was not God's earth large enough for you to migrate?"" Their abode will be Hell, and what an evil destination!"
ENAA591,QA591,ENAA,591,"But those who are helpless, men, women and children, who can neither contrive a plan nor do they know the way,"
ENAA592,QA592,ENAA,592,May well hope for the mercy of God; and God is full of mercy and grace.
ENAA593,QA593,ENAA,593,"Whosoever leaves his country in duty to God will find many places of refuge, and abundance on the earth. And he who leaves his home and becomes an emigre in the way of God and His Messenger, and death overtake him, is sure to receive his reward from God; for God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA594,QA594,ENAA,594,"When you travel in the land there is no sin if you curtail your service of prayer if you fear the unbelievers may harass you, for indeed your open enemies are the infidels."
ENAA595,QA595,ENAA,595,"When you are among them, and have to lead the service of prayer, let one group stand up with you, but let them keep their arms. After they have paid their homage they should go to the rear, and let the group which has not done so yet offer their service of prayer with you, remaining cautious and armed, The infidels wish to find you neglectful of your arms and provisions, to attack you unawares. It will not be a sin if you put aside your arms when you are troubled by rain, or you are ill; but take full precautions. God has reserved for infidels a despicable punishment"
ENAA596,QA596,ENAA,596,"If you are late in performing your service of prayer honour God by remembering Him, standing or sitting or lying on your sides. And when you have security perform your act of prayer befittingly; and praying at fixed hours is prescribed for the faithful."
ENAA597,QA597,ENAA,597,"And do not be chary of pursuing them. If you suffer, they shall also suffer like you. But while you have hope (of success) from God, they have none. Surely God is all-knowing and all-wise."
ENAA598,QA598,ENAA,598,"We have sent down to you the Book containing the truth, in whose light you should judge among the people as God has shown you, and do not be a contender for deceivers."
ENAA599,QA599,ENAA,599,"And seek God's forgiveness, for God is surely forgiving and kind."
ENAA600,QA600,ENAA,600,"Do not argue for those who harbour deceit in their hearts, for God does not love the treacherous and the iniquitous."
ENAA601,QA601,ENAA,601,"They try to hide from (men), but they cannot hide from God who is with them at night when they discuss such matters as He does not approve; but what they do is well within the compass of God."
ENAA602,QA602,ENAA,602,"Well, you are those who pleaded for them in the life of this world; but who will plead for them on the Day of Resurrection or be their security?"
ENAA603,QA603,ENAA,603,"He who does evil or acts against his own interests (by disbelieving), then prays for God's forgiveness, will find God compassionate and merciful."
ENAA604,QA604,ENAA,604,He who earns the wages of sin does so for himself; and God is aware of everything and is wise.
ENAA605,QA605,ENAA,605,"He who commits a mistake or iniquity and ascribes it to one who is innocent, is guilty of calumny and brazen sin."
ENAA606,QA606,ENAA,606,"But for the mercy of God and His grace you would certainly have been misled by a section of them; yet they could not mislead you but themselves alone, and could do you no harm, for God has revealed to you the Book and the Law, and taught you what you did not know. Great have been the blessings of God on you."
ENAA607,QA607,ENAA,607,"Their confidential counsels are seldom for the good, save of those who talk of charity or goodness or peace among men. Whosoever does so for the pleasure of God, We shall give him an ample reward."
ENAA608,QA608,ENAA,608,"And he who opposes the Prophet even after the way has become clear to him, and follows a path other than the way of believers, We shall lead him to what he has chosen for himself, and shall take him to Hell: How evil a journey's end."
ENAA609,QA609,ENAA,609,"God does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to Him, and absolves all else whatsoever He will. And he who associates compeers with God has indeed wandered far astray."
ENAA610,QA610,ENAA,610,In His place they invoke only females (the pagan deities); and instead of Him they invoke Satan the obstinate rebel
ENAA611,QA611,ENAA,611,"Who was condemned by God and who said: ""I shall take from Thy creatures my determinate share,"
ENAA612,QA612,ENAA,612,"And mislead them and tempt them, and order them to slit the ears of animals; and order them to alter God's creation."" He who holds Satan as friend in place of God will assuredly be damned to perdition."
ENAA613,QA613,ENAA,613,"Whatever the promises he makes, whatever the desires he enkindles, and whatever the hopes Satan rouses in them, are no more than delusion."
ENAA614,QA614,ENAA,614,For such the abode is only Hell from which they will find no escape.
ENAA615,QA615,ENAA,615,But those who believe and do good deeds We shall admit into gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever. True is the promise of God; and whose word could be truer than God's?
ENAA616,QA616,ENAA,616,"It is neither dependent on your wishes, nor the wishes of the people of the Book, (but) whosoever does ill will be punished for it, and will find no protector or friend apart from God;"
ENAA617,QA617,ENAA,617,"But he who performs good deeds, whether man or a woman, and is a believer, will surely enter Paradise, and none shall be deprived even of an iota of his reward."
ENAA618,QA618,ENAA,618,"Whose way is better than that of the man who has submitted to God, and does good, and who follows the creed of Abraham the upright? And God chose Abraham as friend."
ENAA619,QA619,ENAA,619,And all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and everything is well within the compass of God.
ENAA620,QA620,ENAA,620,"And they ask you for judgement about women. Tell them: ""God has given you instructions about them. You also read them in the Book concerning orphaned women (in your charge) to whom you deny their ordained rights and yet wish to take them in marriage, as well as in respect of helpless children, that you should be just in the matter of orphans."" The good you do is known to God."
ENAA621,QA621,ENAA,621,"If a woman fears aversion from her husband, or ill treatment, there is no harm if they make a peaceful settlement; and peace is an excellent thing. But men keep self-interest uppermost. Yet if you do good and fear God, God is cognisant of all that you do."
ENAA622,QA622,ENAA,622,"Howsoever you may try you will never be able to treat your wives equally. But do not incline (to one) exclusively and leave (the other) suspended (as it were). Yet if you do the right thing and are just, God is verily forgiving and kind."
ENAA623,QA623,ENAA,623,"If both (decide to) separate, God in His largesse will provide for them; for God is infinite and all wise."
ENAA624,QA624,ENAA,624,"All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. We had commanded those who received the Book before you, and have commanded you too, to obey the laws of God. Even if you deny, surely all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and God is self-sufficient and praise-worthy."
ENAA625,QA625,ENAA,625,For all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and God is sufficient as guardian.

ENAA628,QA628,ENAA,628,"O you who believe, be custodians of justice (and) witnesses for God, even though against yourselves or your parents or your relatives. Whether a man be rich or poor, God is his greater well-wisher than you. So follow not the behests of lust lest you swerve from justice; and if you prevaricate or avoid (giving evidence), God is cognisant of all that you do."
ENAA629,QA629,ENAA,629,"O believers, believe in God and His Messenger and the Book He has revealed to His Apostle, and the Books revealed before. But he who believes not in God and His angels and the Books and the prophets and the Last Day, has wandered far away."
ENAA630,QA630,ENAA,630,"Those who accept the faith, then disbelieve, then return to it, and deny once again and increase in disbelief, will not be forgiven by God or be guided by Him."
ENAA631,QA631,ENAA,631,Give tidings to the hypocrites that painful is their doom.
ENAA632,QA632,ENAA,632,Do those who take unbelievers as their friends in preference to the faithful seek power from them? But all power belongs to God.
ENAA633,QA633,ENAA,633,"You have been commanded in the Book that whensoever you hear God's messages denied or derided, do not sit in that company until they begin talking of other things, or you will be no different from them. Indeed God will put the hypocrites and infidels together in Hell."
ENAA634,QA634,ENAA,634,"Those who wait to see what befalls you, say in ease success comes to you from God: ""Were we not with you?"" But if fortune favours the infidels, they say: ""Did we not overpower you, and yet protected you against the believers?"" But God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection; and God will never give the unbelievers a way over the faithful."
ENAA635,QA635,ENAA,635,"The hypocrites try to deceive God, but He (leads them to) deceive themselves. When they stand up for performing the service of prayer they do so indolently, only for show, and remember God but little,"
ENAA636,QA636,ENAA,636,"Wavering between the two, neither with these nor with those. For them who are not given the guidance by God, you will never find a way."
ENAA637,QA637,ENAA,637,"O believers, do not hold unbelievers as friends in preference to the faithful. Do you want to proffer a clear proof of your own guilt before God?"
ENAA638,QA638,ENAA,638,"The hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of Hell, and you will find none to help them."
ENAA639,QA639,ENAA,639,"But those who repent and amend, and hold firmly to God, and are sincere and wholly obedient to God, are surely with the faithful; and God will bestow on the faithful a great reward."
ENAA640,QA640,ENAA,640,Why should God punish you if you acknowledge the truth and believe? God is responsive to gratitude and is cognisant.
ENAA641,QA641,ENAA,641,"God does not like ill (of others) spoken about, except by him who has been wronged. For God hears all and knows everything."
ENAA642,QA642,ENAA,642,"Whether you do some good openly or in secret, or forgive an ill done to you, (know) that God is forgiving and all-powerful."
ENAA643,QA643,ENAA,643,"Those who believe not in God and His apostles, and desire to differentiate between God and His messengers, and say: ""We believe in some and not in the others,"" and wish to find a way (between affirmation and denial),"
ENAA644,QA644,ENAA,644,Are verily the real unbelievers. And We have reserved for unbelievers an ignominious punishment.
ENAA645,QA645,ENAA,645,"But those who believe in God and His apostles and make no distinction among any of them, will be given by Him their recompense; for God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA646,QA646,ENAA,646,"The people of the Book demand of you to bring for them a book from heaven. But of Moses they had asked a bigger thing, and demanded: ""Show us God face to face."" They were struck by lightning then as punishment for their wickedness. Even then they made the calf, when clear signs had reached them. Still We forgave them and gave Moses clear authority."
ENAA647,QA647,ENAA,647,"We exalted them on the Mount, and they gave a solemn pledge, and We said to them: ""Enter the gates submissively,"" and told them: ""Do not break the Sabbath,"" and took a solemn pledge from them."
ENAA648,QA648,ENAA,648,"So (they were punished) for breaking the covenant and disbelieving the signs of God, and for killing the prophets unjustly, and saying: ""Our hearts are enfolded in covers,"" (though) in fact God had sealed them because of their unbelief; so they do not believe except a few;"
ENAA649,QA649,ENAA,649,And because they denied and spoke dreadful calumnies of Mary;
ENAA650,QA650,ENAA,650,"And for saying: ""We killed the Christ, Jesus, son of Mary, who was an apostle of God;"" but they neither killed nor crucified him, though it so appeared to them. Those who disagree in the matter are only lost in doubt. They have no knowledge about it other than conjecture, for surely they did not kill him,"
ENAA651,QA651,ENAA,651,But God raised him up (in position) and closer to Himself; and God is all-mighty and all-wise.
ENAA652,QA652,ENAA,652,There is not one among the people of the Book who will not believe in it before his death; and he will be a witness over them on the Day of Resurrection.
ENAA653,QA653,ENAA,653,"Because of the wickedness of some among the Jews, and because they obstructed people from the way of God, We forbade them many things which were lawful for them;"
ENAA654,QA654,ENAA,654,And because they practised usury although it had been forbidden them; and for using others' wealth unjustly. For those who are unbelievers among them We have reserved a painful punishment.
ENAA655,QA655,ENAA,655,"But to the learned among them, and the believers who affirm what has been revealed to you and was revealed to those before you, and to those who fulfil their devotional obligations, who pay the zakat and believe in God and the Last Day, We shall give a great reward."
ENAA656,QA656,ENAA,656,"We have sent revelations to you as We sent revelations to Noah and the prophets (who came) after him; and We sent revelations to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob, and their offspring, and to Jesus and Job, and to Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and to David We gave the Book of Psalms,"
ENAA657,QA657,ENAA,657,"And to many an apostle We have mentioned before, and to many other apostles We have not mentioned to you; and to Moses God spoke directly."
ENAA658,QA658,ENAA,658,All these apostles of good news and admonition were sent so that after the apostles men may have no argument against God. God is all-powerful and all-wise.
ENAA659,QA659,ENAA,659,"God is Himself witness to what has been revealed to you, and revealed with His knowledge, and the angels are witness; and God is sufficient as witness."
ENAA660,QA660,ENAA,660,"Those who denied and turned away from the path of God, have wandered far astray."
ENAA661,QA661,ENAA,661,"Those who deny and transgress will not be forgiven by God, nor be shown the way"
ENAA662,QA662,ENAA,662,"Except to Hell, where they will abide for ever; and this is how (the law of God) works inevitably."
ENAA663,QA663,ENAA,663,"O men, the Apostle has now come to you, bringing the truth from your Lord; so believe for your own good; but if you deny (then remember) that all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God; and God is all-knowing and all-wise."
ENAA664,QA664,ENAA,664,"O people of the Book, do not be fanatical in your faith, and say nothing but the truth about God. The Messiah who is Jesus, son of Mary, was only an apostle of God, and a command of His which He sent to Mary, as a mercy from Him. So believe in God and His apostles, and do not call Him 'Trinity'. Abstain from this for your own good; for God is only one God, and far from His glory is it to beget a son. All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him; and sufficient is God for all help."
ENAA665,QA665,ENAA,665,"The Christ will never disdain to be a votary of God, nor will the angels close to Him. And those who disdain to serve Him and are proud (should remember) that they will all go back to Him in the end."
ENAA666,QA666,ENAA,666,"Then those who believed and earned good deeds will be given their recompense in full, and even more out of grace. But those who disdain and who boast will receive a painful punishment. They will find none except God to help them or save them."
ENAA667,QA667,ENAA,667,"O men, you have received infallible proof from your Lord, and We have sent down a beacon light to you."
ENAA668,QA668,ENAA,668,"So those who believe in God and hold fast to Him shall indeed be received into His mercy and His grace, and be guided to Him the straight path."
ENAA669,QA669,ENAA,669,"They ask you for judgement about 'Kalalah' (a man who dies childless). Say: ""God has given a decision in the matter of inheritance."" If a man dies and leaves no child behind but have a sister, she will get a half of what he owned, as he would have done the whole of what she possessed if she had died a childless person. In ease he has two sisters then they will get two-thirds of the heritage. But if he has both brothers and sisters, the male will inherit a share equal to that of two females. God makes this manifest to you lest you wander astray, for God has knowledge of everything."
ENAA670,QA670,ENAA,670,"O YOU WHO believe, fulfil your obligations. Made lawful (as food) for you are animals except those mentioned (here); but unlawful during Pilgrimage is game. God ordains whatsoever He wills."
ENAA671,QA671,ENAA,671,"O you who believe, do not violate the (sanctity of) offerings to God, nor the rites of the holy month, nor sacrificial cattle with garlands (that are brought to the Ka'bah), nor of the people who flock to the Holy House seeking the bounties of their Lord, and His pleasure. Hunt when you have laid aside the robe of the pilgrim. And do not let your hatred of a people who had barred you from the Holy Mosque lead you to aggression. But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment."
ENAA672,QA672,ENAA,672,"Forbidden you is carrion and blood, and the flesh of the swine, and whatsoever has been killed in the name of some other than God, and whatever has been strangled, or killed by a blow or a fall, or by goring, or that which has been mauled by wild beasts unless slaughtered while still alive; and that which has been slaughtered at altars is forbidden, and also dividing the meat by casting lots with arrows. All this is sinful. Today the unbelievers have lost every hope of (despoiling) your creed; so do not fear them, fear Me. Today I have perfected your system of belief and bestowed My favours upon you in full, and have chosen submission (al-Islam) as the creed for you. If one of you is driven by hunger (to eat the forbidden) without the evil intent of sinning, then God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA673,QA673,ENAA,673,"They ask you what is lawful for them. Say: ""All things are lawful for you that are clean, and what the trained hunting animals take for you as you have trained then, in the light of God's teachings, but read over them the name of God, and fear (straying from the path of) God, for God is swift in the reckoning."""
ENAA674,QA674,ENAA,674,"On this day all things that are clean have been made lawful for you; and made lawful for you is the food of the people of the Book, as your food is made lawful for them. And lawful are the chaste Muslim women, and the women of the people of the Book who are chaste, (for marriage) and not fornication or liaison, if you give them their dowries. Useless shall be rendered the acts of those who turn back on their faith, and they will be among the losers in the life to come."
ENAA675,QA675,ENAA,675,"O believers, when you stand up for the service of prayer wash your faces and hands up to elbows, and also wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of seminal pollution, then bathe and purify yourself well. But in case you are ill or are travelling, or you have satisfied the call of nature, or have slept with a woman, and you cannot find water, then take wholesome dust and pass it over your face and your hands, for God does not wish to impose any hardship on you. He wishes to purify you, and grace you with His favours in full so that you may be grateful."
ENAA676,QA676,ENAA,676,"Remember the favours He bestowed on you, and the covenant He cemented with you, when you said: ""We have heard and obey."" Have fear of God, for He knows the secrets of your heart."
ENAA677,QA677,ENAA,677,"O you who believe, stand up as witnesses for God in all fairness, and do not let the hatred of a people deviate you from justice. Be just: This is closest to piety; and beware of God. Surely God is aware of all you do."
ENAA678,QA678,ENAA,678,God has made a promise of forgiveness and the highest reward to those who believe and perform good deeds.
ENAA679,QA679,ENAA,679,But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are the people of Hell.
ENAA680,QA680,ENAA,680,"O believers, remember the favours God bestowed on you when a people raised their hands against you and He restrained their hands. So fear God; and the faithful should place their trust in God."
ENAA681,QA681,ENAA,681,"God covenanted the people of Israel and raised twelve leaders among them, and said: ""I shall verily be with you. If you fulfil your devotional obligations, pay the zakat and believe in My apostles and support them, and give a goodly loan to God, I shall certainly absolve you of your evil, and admit you to gardens with streams of running water. But whosoever among you denies after this, will have wandered away from the right path."""
ENAA682,QA682,ENAA,682,"When they dishonoured their pledge We condemned them, and hardened their hearts. So they distort the words of the Scripture out of context, and have forgotten some of what they were warned against. You will always hear of treachery on their part except that of a few. But forbear and forgive them, for God loves those who do good."
ENAA683,QA683,ENAA,683,"We had taken the pledge of those also who call themselves Christians. But they too forgot to take advantage of the warning they were given. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them to last till the Day of Resurrection, when God will inform them of what they were doing."
ENAA684,QA684,ENAA,684,"O people of the Book, Our Apostle has come to you, announcing many things of the Scriptures that you have suppressed, passing over some others. To you has come light and a clear Book from God"
ENAA685,QA685,ENAA,685,"Through which God will lead those who follow His pleasure to the path of peace, and guide them out of darkness into light by His will, and to the path that is straight."
ENAA686,QA686,ENAA,686,"Verily they are unbelievers who say: ""The Messiah, son of Mary, is God."" You ask them: ""Who could prevail against God if He had chosen to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and the rest of mankind?"" For God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lies between them. He creates what He please, for God has the power over all things."
ENAA687,QA687,ENAA,687,"Say the Jews and the Christians: ""We are sons of God and beloved of Him."" Say: ""Why does He punish you then for your sins? No: You are only mortals, of His creation."" He can punish whom He please and pardon whom He will, for God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and everything will go back to Him."
ENAA688,QA688,ENAA,688,"O you people of the Book, Our Apostle has come to you when apostles had ceased to come long ago, lest you said: ""There did not come to us any messenger of good news or of warnings."" So now there has reached you a bearer of good tidings and of warnings; for God has the power over all things."
ENAA689,QA689,ENAA,689,"Remember when Moses said to his people: ""O my people, remember the favours that God bestowed on you when He appointed apostles from among you, and made you kings and gave you what had never been given to any one in the world."

ENAA697,QA697,ENAA,697,"If you raise your hand to kill me, I will raise not mine to kill you, for I fear God, the Lord of all the worlds;"
ENAA698,QA698,ENAA,698,"I would rather you suffered the punishment for sinning against me, and for your own sin, and became an inmate of Hell. And that is the requital for the unjust."""
ENAA699,QA699,ENAA,699,"Then the other was induced by his passion to murder his brother, and he killed him, and became one of the damned."
ENAA700,QA700,ENAA,700,"Then God sent a raven which scratched the ground in order to show him how to hide the nakedness of his brother. ""Alas, the woe,"" said he, ""that I could not be even like the raven and hide the nakedness of my brother,"" and was filled with remorse."
ENAA701,QA701,ENAA,701,"That is why We decreed for the children of Israel that whosoever kills a human being, except (as punishment) for murder or for spreading corruption in the land, it shall be like killing all humanity; and whosoever saves a life, saves the entire human race. Our apostles brought clear proofs to them; but even after that most of them committed excesses in the land."
ENAA702,QA702,ENAA,702,"The punishment for those who wage war against God and His Prophet, and perpetrate disorders in the land, is to kill or hang them, or have a hand on one side and a foot on the other cut off, or banish them from the land.

You cannot intercede with God for him whom God would not show the way. These are the people whose hearts God does not wish to purify.

ENAA713,QA713,ENAA,713,"We sent down the Torah which contains guidance and light, in accordance with which the prophets who were obedient (to God) gave instructions to the Jews, as did the rabbis and priests, for they were the custodians and witnesses of God's writ. So, therefore, do not fear men, fear Me, and barter not My messages away for a paltry gain. Those who do not judge by God's revelations are infidels indeed."
ENAA714,QA714,ENAA,714,"And there (in the Torah) We had ordained for them a life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds retribution, though he who forgoes it out of charity, atones for his sins. And those who do not judge by God's revelations are unjust."
ENAA715,QA715,ENAA,715,"Later, in the train (of the prophets), We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah which had been (Sent down) before him, and gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, which corroborated the earlier Torah, a guidance and warning for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path."

So judge between them by what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, side-stepping the truth that has reached you. To each of you We have given a law and a way and a pattern of life. If God had pleased He could surely have made you one people (professing one faith). But He wished to try and test you by that which He gave you. So try to excel in good deeds. To Him will you all return in the end, when He will tell you of what you were at variance."
ENAA718,QA718,ENAA,718,"Judge between them in the light of what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, and beware of them lest they lead you away from the guidance sent down to you by God. If they turn away, then know that God is sure to punish them for some of their sins; and many of them are transgressors."
ENAA719,QA719,ENAA,719,Do they seek a judgement of the days of pagan ignorance? But who could be a better judge than God for those who are firm in their faith?
ENAA720,QA720,ENAA,720,"O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and anyone who makes them his friends is surely one of them; and God does not guide the unjust."
ENAA721,QA721,ENAA,721,"You will notice that those whose hearts are afflicted with sickness (of doubt) only hasten to join them and say: ""We fear lest misfortune should surround us."" It may well be that God may soon send (you) success, or other command of His. Then will they be repentant of what they had concealed in their hearts."
ENAA722,QA722,ENAA,722,"Then the believers will say: ""Are these the people who had sworn by God on solemn oath and said: ""We are surely with you?"" Wasted have been all their deeds, and losers they remain."
ENAA723,QA723,ENAA,723,"O believers, any one of you who turns back on his faith (should remember) that God could verily bring (in your place) another people whom He would love as they would love Him, gentle with believers, unbending with infidels, who would strive in the way of God, unafraid of blame by any slanderer. Such is the favour of God which He bestows on whomsoever He will. God is infinite and all-knowing."
ENAA724,QA724,ENAA,724,"Your only friends are God and His Messenger, and those who believe and are steadfast in devotion, who pay the zakat and bow in homage (before God)."
ENAA725,QA725,ENAA,725,"And those who take God and His Prophet and the faithful as their friends are indeed men of God, who will surely be victorious."
ENAA726,QA726,ENAA,726,"O believers, do not make friends with those who mock and make a sport of your faith, who were given the Book before you, and with unbelievers; and fear God if you truly believe;"
ENAA727,QA727,ENAA,727,"(Nor make friends with) those who, when you call (the faithful) to prayer, make mock of it and jest, because they do not understand."
ENAA728,QA728,ENAA,728,"Say to them: ""O people of the Book, what reason have you for disliking us other than that we believe in God and what has been sent down to us, and was sent down before, and because most of you are disobedient?"""
ENAA729,QA729,ENAA,729,"Say: ""Shall I inform you who will receive the worst chastisement from God? They who were condemned by God, and on whom fell His wrath, and those who were turned to apes and swine, and those who worship the powers of evil. They are in the worse gradation, and farthest away from the right path."""
ENAA730,QA730,ENAA,730,"When they come to you they say: ""We believe;"" but unbelieving they came and unbelieving go; and God is aware of what they conceal in their hearts."
ENAA731,QA731,ENAA,731,"You will see among them many who rush into sin and wickedness, and devour unlawful gain. How evil are the things they do!"
ENAA732,QA732,ENAA,732,Why do not their rabbis and priests prohibit them from talking of sinful things and from devouring unlawful gain? Evil are the acts they commit!
ENAA733,QA733,ENAA,733,"The Jews say: ""Bound are the hands of God."" Tied be their own hands, and damned may they be for saying what they say! In fact, both His hands are open wide: He spends of His bounty in any way He please. But what your Lord has revealed to you will only increase their rebellion and unbelief. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them (which will last) till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by God. Yet they rush around to spread corruption in the land; but God does not love those who are corrupt."
ENAA734,QA734,ENAA,734,"If the people of the Book had believed and feared, We would surely have absolved them of their sins, and admitted them to gardens of delight."
ENAA735,QA735,ENAA,735,"And if they had followed the teachings of the Torah and the Gospel, and what has been sent down to them by their Lord, they would surely have enjoyed (blessings) from the heavens above and the earth below their feet."
ENAA736,QA736,ENAA,736,"Some among them are moderate, but evil is what most of them do! O Prophet, announce what has reached you from your Lord, for if you do not, you will not have delivered His message. God will preserve you from (the mischief of) men; for God does not guide those who do not believe."
ENAA737,QA737,ENAA,737,"Say to them: ""O people of the Book, you have no ground (for argument) until you follow the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to you by your Lord."" But what has been revealed to you by your Lord will surely increase rebellion and unbelief in many; so do not grieve for those who do not believe."
ENAA738,QA738,ENAA,738,"All those who believe, and the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians, in fact any one who believes in God and the Last Day, and performs good deeds, will have nothing to fear or regret."
ENAA739,QA739,ENAA,739,"We had taken a solemn pledge from the children of Israel, and sent messengers to them; but whenever an apostle came to them bringing what did not suit their mood, they called one imposter, another they slew,"
ENAA740,QA740,ENAA,740,And imagined that no trials would befall them; and they turned deaf and blind (to the truth). But God still turned to them; yet many of them turned blind and deaf again; but God sees everything they do.
ENAA741,QA741,ENAA,741,"They are surely infidels who say: ""God is the Christ, son of Mary."" But the Christ had only said: ""O children of Israel, worship God who is my Lord and your Lord."" Whosoever associates a compeer with God, will have Paradise denied to him by God, and his abode shall be Hell; and the sinners will have none to help them."
ENAA742,QA742,ENAA,742,"Disbelievers are they surely who say: ""God is the third of the trinity;"" but there is no god other than God the one. And if they do not desist from saying what they say, then indeed those among them who persist in disbelief will suffer painful punishment."
ENAA743,QA743,ENAA,743,Why do they not turn to God and ask His forgiveness? God is forgiving and kind.
ENAA744,QA744,ENAA,744,"The Christ, son of Mary, was but an apostle, and many apostles had (come and) gone before him; and his mother was a woman of truth. They both ate the (same) food (as men). Behold, how We show men clear signs, and behold, how they wander astray!"
ENAA745,QA745,ENAA,745,"Tell them: ""Leaving God aside, will you worship something that has no power over your loss or gain?"" But God is all-hearing and all-knowing."
ENAA746,QA746,ENAA,746,"Tell them: ""O people of the Book, do not overstep the bounds of truth in your beliefs, and follow not the wishes of a people who had erred before, and led many others astray, and wandered away from the right path."""
ENAA747,QA747,ENAA,747,"Cursed were disbelievers among the children of Israel by David and Jesus, son of Mary, because they rebelled and transgressed the bounds."
ENAA748,QA748,ENAA,748,They did not restrain one another from the wicked things they used to do; and vile were the things that they were doing!
ENAA749,QA749,ENAA,749,"You can see among them many allying themselves with the infidels. Vile it was what they sent ahead of them, so that God's indignation came upon them; and torment will they suffer an eternity."
ENAA750,QA750,ENAA,750,"If they had believed in God and the Prophet and what had been revealed to him, they would never have held them as allies; and many among them are transgressors."
ENAA751,QA751,ENAA,751,"You will find the Jews and idolaters most excessive in hatred of those who believe; and the closest in love to the faithful are the people who say: ""We are the followers of Christ,"" because there are priests and monks among them, and they are not arrogant."
ENAA752,QA752,ENAA,752,"For when they listen to what has been revealed to this Apostle, you can see their eyes brim over with tears at the truth which they recognise, and say: ""O Lord, we believe; put us down among those who bear witness (to the truth)."
ENAA753,QA753,ENAA,753,"And why should we not believe in God and what has come down to us of the truth? And we hope to be admitted by our Lord among those who are upright and do good?"""
ENAA754,QA754,ENAA,754,"God will reward them for saying so with gardens where streams flow by, where they will live for ever. This is the recompense of those who do good."
ENAA755,QA755,ENAA,755,But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations are residents of Hell.
ENAA756,QA756,ENAA,756,"O believers, do not forbid the good things God has made lawful for you; and do not transgress. God does not love transgressors."
ENAA757,QA757,ENAA,757,"Eat what is lawful and good of the provisions God has bestowed on you, and fear God in whom you believe."
ENAA758,QA758,ENAA,758,"God does not punish you but for what you swear in earnest. The expiation (for breaking an oath) is feeding ten persons who are poor, with food that you give your own families, or clothing them, or freeing a slave. But he who cannot do so should fast for three days. This is the expiation for an oath when you have sworn it. So abide by your oaths. Thus God makes His commandments clear to you: You may perhaps be grateful."
ENAA759,QA759,ENAA,759,"O believers, this wine and gambling, these idols, and these arrows you use for divination, are all acts of Satan; so keep away from them. You may haply prosper."
ENAA760,QA760,ENAA,760,"Satan only wishes to create among you enmity and hatred through wine and gambling, and to divert you from the remembrance of God and prayer. Will you therefore not desist?"
ENAA761,QA761,ENAA,761,"Obey God and the Prophet, and beware. If you turn away, remember, that the duty of Our Apostle is to give you a clear warning."
ENAA762,QA762,ENAA,762,"Those who believe and perform good deeds will not be held guilty for what they have eaten (in the past) if they fear God and believe, and do good things and are conscious (of God) and believe, and still fear and do good, for God loves those who do good."
ENAA763,QA763,ENAA,763,"O you who believe, God will surely try you with the game that you take with your hands or your lances, in order to know who fear Him unseen. Whosoever transgress after this will suffer grievous punishment."
ENAA764,QA764,ENAA,764,"O you who believe, do not kill game when you are on pilgrimage. And anyone among you who does so on purpose should offer livestock of equivalent value, determined by two honourable persons among you, (as atonement), to be brought to the Ka'bah as an offering; or else expiate by giving food to the poor, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he may realise the gravity of his deed. God has forgiven what has happened in the past; but any one who does so again will be punished by God. And God is severe in requital."
ENAA765,QA765,ENAA,765,"Lawful is all game of the water for you, and eating of it as food, so that you and the travellers may benefit by it. But unlawful is game of the jungle when you are on pilgrimage. Fear God before whom you have to gather in the end."
ENAA766,QA766,ENAA,766,"God has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, a means of support for mankind, as also the holy month, the sacrificial offerings, and consecrated cattle, so that you may understand that known to God is all that is in the heavens and the earth, and God has knowledge of everything."
ENAA767,QA767,ENAA,767,"Know that the punishment of God is severe, but that God is also forgiving and kind."
ENAA768,QA768,ENAA,768,It is for the Prophet to convey the message: God knows what you reveal and what you hide.
ENAA769,QA769,ENAA,769,"Tell them: ""The unclean and the pure are not equal, even though the abundance of the unclean may be pleasing to you."" So fear God, O men of wisdom; you may haply find success."
ENAA770,QA770,ENAA,770,"O believers, do not ask about things which, if made known to you, may vex you. But if you ask about them when the Qur'an is being revealed they will be unfolded to you. God has overlooked (your failings) in this (respect), for God is forgiving and forbearing."
ENAA771,QA771,ENAA,771,"Such things were asked by a people before you, but they disbelieved them afterwards."
ENAA772,QA772,ENAA,772,"God has not sanctioned Baheerah or Sa'ibah, Waseelah or Ham. The unbelievers fabricate lies of God, for many of them are devoid of sense."
ENAA773,QA773,ENAA,773,"When you say to them: ""Come to what God has revealed, and the Prophet,"" they say: ""Sufficient to us is the faith that our fathers had followed,"" even though their fathers had no knowledge or guidance."
ENAA774,QA774,ENAA,774,"O you who believe, on you rests (the responsibility) for your own selves. If you follow the right path those who have gone astray will not be able to do you harm. To God have all of you to return, when He will tell you what you were doing."
ENAA775,QA775,ENAA,775,"O you who believe, let two honest men among you be witness when you dictate your last will and testament as (the hour of) death draws near; and if death approaches while you are on a journey, two men other than yours. Detain them after the service of prayer, and if you doubt their word make them swear by God that: ""We shall not take a bribe even though it be offered by a near relative, nor hide the testimony of God, for then we shall surely be sinful."""
ENAA776,QA776,ENAA,776,"If it transpires they have concealed the truth, two of those who are immediately concerned should take their place and swear by God: ""Our testimony is truer than theirs. We have stated no more (than the truth), or else we shall be unjust"""
ENAA777,QA777,ENAA,777,"It is thus likely that men will bear witness rightly, or else fear that their oaths may be disproved by oaths given after them. So fear God, and do not forget that God does not guide the iniquitous."
ENAA778,QA778,ENAA,778,"The day God will gather the apostles and ask: ""What answer was made to you?"" They will say: ""We know not. You alone know the secrets unknown."""
ENAA779,QA779,ENAA,779,"And when God will say: ""O Jesus, son of Mary, remember the favours I bestowed on you and your mother, and reinforced you with divine grace that you spoke to men when in the cradle, and when in the prime of life; when I taught you the law and the judgement and the Torah and the Gospel; when you formed the state of your people's destiny out of mire and you breathed (a new spirit) into it, and they rose by My leave; when you healed the blind by My leave, and the leper; when you put life into the dead by My will; and when I held back the children of Israel from you when you brought to them My signs, and the disbelievers among them said: ""Surely these are nothing but pure magic."""
ENAA780,QA780,ENAA,780,"And when I inspired the disciples (through Jesus) to believe in Me and My apostle, they said: ""We believe, and You bear witness that we submit"""
ENAA781,QA781,ENAA,781,"When the disciples said: ""O Jesus, son of Mary, could your Lord send down for us a table laid with food?"" he said: ""Fear God, if indeed you believe."""
ENAA782,QA782,ENAA,782,"They said: ""We should like to eat of it to reassure our hearts and to know that it's the truth you have told us, and that we should be witness to it."""
ENAA783,QA783,ENAA,783,"Said Jesus, son of Mary. ""O God, our Lord, send down a table well laid out with food from the skies so that this day may be a day of feast for the earlier among us and the later, and a token from You. Give us our (daily) bread, for You are the best of all givers of food."""
ENAA784,QA784,ENAA,784,"And said God: ""I shall send it down to you; but if any of you disbelieve after this, I shall inflict such punishment on him as I never shall inflict on any other creature."""
ENAA785,QA785,ENAA,785,"And when God will ask: ""O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to mankind: 'Worship me and my mother as two deities apart from God?' (Jesus) will answer: ""Halleluja. Could I say what I knew I had no right (to say)? Had I said it You would surely have known, for You know what is in my heart though I know not what You have. You alone know the secrets unknown."
ENAA786,QA786,ENAA,786,"I said nought to them but what You commanded me: Worship God, my Lord and your Lord. And so long as I dwelt with them I was witness over their actions. And after my life had been done, You were their keeper; and You are a witness over all things."
ENAA787,QA787,ENAA,787,"If You punish them, indeed they are Your creatures; if You pardon them, indeed You are mighty and wise."""
ENAA788,QA788,ENAA,788,"God will say: 'This is the day when the truthful shall profit by their truthfulness. For them will be gardens with streams running by, where they will for ever abide."" God will accept them, and they will be gratified in (obeying) Him. This will surely be happiness supreme."
ENAA789,QA789,ENAA,789,"To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and His the power over everything."
ENAA790,QA790,ENAA,790,"ALL PRAISE BE to God who created the heavens and the earth, and ordained darkness and light. Yet the unbelievers make the others equal of their Lord."
ENAA791,QA791,ENAA,791,"It is He who created you from clay then determined a term (of life) for you, and a term (is fixed) with Him. Even then you doubt."
ENAA792,QA792,ENAA,792,"He is God in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you hide and bring out into the open, and knows what you earn (of good and evil)."
ENAA793,QA793,ENAA,793,Yet no sign of their Lord comes to them but they turn away from it.
ENAA794,QA794,ENAA,794,So they disbelieved the truth when it came to them; but they will soon come to know the reality of what they had ridiculed.
ENAA795,QA795,ENAA,795,"Do they not see how many generations We laid low before them, whom We had firmly established in the land as We have not established you, and showered abundant rain on them, and made rivers lap at their feet, yet whom We destroyed for their sins, and raised new generations after them?"
ENAA796,QA796,ENAA,796,"Even if We had sent you a transcript on paper which they could feel with their hands, the unbelievers would have said: ""This is nothing but clear sorcery."""
ENAA797,QA797,ENAA,797,"They say: ""How is it no angel was sent down to him?"" Had We sent an angel down the matter would have come to end, and they would have had no respite."
ENAA798,QA798,ENAA,798,"Even if We had sent down an angel as messenger he would have appeared in the garb of a man and filled them with confusion, like the one they are filled with."
ENAA799,QA799,ENAA,799,Surely the apostles have been mocked before you; but what they had mocked rebounded on the mockers themselves.
ENAA800,QA800,ENAA,800,"Say: ""Travel in the land and see what happened to those who disbelieved."""
ENAA801,QA801,ENAA,801,"And ask: ""To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?"" Say: ""To God."" He has prescribed grace for Himself. He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection which is certain to come. Only they who are lost of soul will not come to believe."

ENAA840,QA840,ENAA,840,"Warn those who fear, through this (Qur'an), that they will be gathered before their Lord, and they will have none to protect or intercede for them apart from Him. They may haply take heed for themselves."
ENAA841,QA841,ENAA,841,"Do not turn away those who supplicate their Lord morning and evening, seeking His magnificence. You are not accountable for them in the least, nor they for you at all. If you drive them away you will only be unjust."
ENAA842,QA842,ENAA,842,"Thus do We try men through one another so that they may ask: ""Are these the ones of all of us who have been favoured by God?"" Does God not know who are the grateful?"
ENAA843,QA843,ENAA,843,"When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say to them: ""Peace on you."" Your Lord has prescribed grace for Himself, so that in case one of you commits evil out of ignorance, then feels repentant and reforms, He may be forgiving and kind."

ENAA849,QA849,ENAA,849,"It is He indeed who sends you to death at night, and knows what you do in the day, then makes you rise with it again in order that the fixed term of life be fulfilled. Then to Him you will be returned when He will tell you what you did."

Remind them hereby lest a man is doomed for what he has done. He will have none to help him, or intercede for him, other than God; and even if he offer all the ransoms they will not be accepted from him. They are those who will be destroyed by their own acts.

ENAA881,QA881,ENAA,881,"And this (Qur'an) is another Book that We have revealed, blessed, affirming the earlier (revelations), so that you may warn the people of (Makkah) the town of towns, and those who live around it.

ENAA897,QA897,ENAA,897,"Do not revile those who invoke others apart from God, lest they begin to revile God out of malice and ignorance. We have made attractive their deeds to every people. They have to go back to their Lord, when He will tell them what they used to do."

ENAA900,QA900,ENAA,900,"Even if We send down the angels to them, and the dead should speak to them, and We gather all things before their eyes, they will not believe, unless God should will, for most of them are ignorant."
ENAA901,QA901,ENAA,901,"That is how We have made for each apostle opponents, the satans among men and jinns, who inspire one another with deceitful talk. But if your Lord had willed they would not have done so. Pay no attention to them and to what they fabricate."

ENAA908,QA908,ENAA,908,"And why should you not eat of that over which the name of God has been pronounced, when He has made it distinctly clear what is forbidden, unless you are constrained to do so. Surely many (men) mislead others into following their vain desires through lack of knowledge. Your Lord certainly knows the transgressors."
ENAA909,QA909,ENAA,909,Discard both the visible and invisible sin. For those who sin will be punished for what they have done.
ENAA910,QA910,ENAA,910,"Do not eat of that over which God's name has not been pronounced, for that would amount to exceeding the limits of law. Certainly the devils inspire their proteges to dispute with you: If you obey them, you will surely become an idolater."
ENAA911,QA911,ENAA,911,"Can he who was lifeless, to whom We gave life, and gave him a light in whose glow he walks among men, be like him who is used to darkness from which he can never emerge? Thus have been their doings made attractive to unbelievers."
ENAA912,QA912,ENAA,912,And thus have We placed in every city the greatest of the sinners to contrive and deceive; yet they contrive against no one but themselves even though they do not know.
ENAA913,QA913,ENAA,913,"Every time a sign comes to them they say: ""We shall never believe till what God's apostles had been given comes to us."" God knows best where to direct His messages. A degradation will befall the sinners and chastisement from God for deceiving."
ENAA914,QA914,ENAA,914,"Thus God guides whomsoever He please by opening wide his breast to surrender; and Straitens the breasts of those He allows to go astray, (who feel suffocated) as if they were ascending the skies. Thus will God punish those who do not believe."
ENAA915,QA915,ENAA,915,This is the straight path of your Lord. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who reflect.

But their proteges among men will say: ""O our Lord, we lived a life of mutual gain, but have now reached the term You ordained for us."" ""Your abode is Hell,"" He will say, ""where you will dwell for ever, unless God please otherwise."" Verily your Lord is wise and all-knowing."
ENAA918,QA918,ENAA,918,Thus do We place some sinners over others as requital for their deeds.
ENAA919,QA919,ENAA,919,"O you assembly of jinns and men, did not apostles come to you from among you, communicating My signs to you, bringing warnings of this your day (of Doom)?"" They will answer: ""We bear witness to our sins."" They were surely deluded by the life of the world, and bore witness against themselves because they were unbelievers."
ENAA920,QA920,ENAA,920,And this (so that it may be clear) that your Lord does not destroy towns and cities arbitrarily while the citizens remain unaware.
ENAA921,QA921,ENAA,921,"Every one has his place according to his deeds, for your Lord is not negligent of what you do."
ENAA922,QA922,ENAA,922,"Your Lord is all-sufficient and full of benevolence. He can take you away if He please, and make whom He will succeed you, as He had raised you from the progeny of others."
ENAA923,QA923,ENAA,923,The promise that was made to you is bound to be fulfilled. It is not in your power to defeat it.

How bad is the judgement that they make!"
ENAA926,QA926,ENAA,926,In the same way have their companions shown many unbelievers the killing of their children as desirable in order to ruin them and falsify their faith. If God had so willed they would never have done so. Leave them to their falsehoods.
ENAA927,QA927,ENAA,927,"They also say: ""These cattle and these crops are consecrated. None may eat of them other than those we permit,"" -- so they assert. ""And the use of these cattle is forbidden for carrying burden."" They do not pronounce the name of God on certain animals, inventing lies against Him. He will punish them for what they fabricate."
ENAA928,QA928,ENAA,928,"And they say: ""Whatever is in the wombs of these cattle is only meant for men and forbidden our women; but in case it should be still-born both could eat it."" God will punish them for what they assert. He is all-wise and all-knowing."
ENAA929,QA929,ENAA,929,"They will surely perish who kill their offspring in ignorance foolhardily, and forbid the food that God has given them by fabricating lies against God. Misguided are they surely, and will never come to guidance."
ENAA930,QA930,ENAA,930,"It is He who grew the gardens, trellised and bowered, and palm trees and land sown with corn and many other seeds, and olives and pomegranates, alike and yet unlike. So eat of their fruit when they are in fruit, and give on the day of harvesting His due, and do not be extravagant, for God does not love those who are prodigal."
ENAA931,QA931,ENAA,931,"He has created beasts of burden and cattle for slaughter. So eat of what God has given you for food, and do not walk in the footsteps of Satan who is surely your declared enemy."
ENAA932,QA932,ENAA,932,"There are eight pairs, two of the species of sheep and two of goats. Ask them which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs? Produce the sanction if you are truthful."

Were you present at the time God issued this command?"" Who then could be more wicked than he who fabricates a lie and ascribes it to God to mislead men, without any knowledge? God does not guide the miscreants."
ENAA934,QA934,ENAA,934,"You tell them: ""In all the commands revealed to me I find nothing which men have been forbidden to eat except carrion and running blood and flesh of the swine for it is unclean, or meat consecrated in the name of some other than God, which is profane. But if one is constrained to eat of these without craving or reverting to it, then surely your Lord is forgiving and kind."""
ENAA935,QA935,ENAA,935,"We made unlawful for the Jews all animals with claws or nails, and the fat of the oxen and sheep, except that on their backs or their intestines, or which remains attached to their bones. This was the punishment for their insubordination; and what We say is true."

ENAA937,QA937,ENAA,937,"But the idolaters say: ""If God had so willed we would not have associated (others with Him), nor would have our fathers, nor would we have forbidden any thing."" So had others denied before them, and had to taste Our punishment in the end. Ask them: ""Have you any knowledge? Then display it. You follow nothing but conjecture, and are nothing but liars."""

Then even if they testify, you should not testify with them; and do not follow the wishes of those who deny Our signs and believe not in the Hereafter, and make others the equal of their Lord."
ENAA940,QA940,ENAA,940,"Tell them: ""Come, I will read out what your Lord has made binding on you: That you make none the equal of God, and be good to your parents, and do not abandon your children out of poverty, for We give you food and We shall provide for them; and avoid what is shameful, whether open or hidden, and do not take a life which God has forbidden, unless for some just cause. These things has God enjoined on you. Haply you may understand."
ENAA941,QA941,ENAA,941,"Do not spend the belongings of the orphans but for their betterment, until they come of age; and give in full measure, and weigh justly on the balance. God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. When you say a thing, let it be just, even though the matter relate to a relative of yours, and fulfil a promise made to God. These are the things that He has enjoined that you may take heed."

ENAA1225,QA1225,ENAA,1225,"O Prophet, urge the faithful to fight. If there are twenty among you with determination they will vanquish two hundred; and if there are a hundred then they will vanquish a thousand unbelievers, for they are people devoid of understanding."

You are not responsible for protecting those who embraced the faith but did not leave their homes, until they do so.

ENAA1239,QA1239,ENAA,1239,"Except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty, who have not failed you in the least, nor helped anyone against you. Fulfil your obligations to them during the term (of the treaty). God loves those who take heed for themselves."

ENAA1243,QA1243,ENAA,1243,"How (can they be trusted)? If they prevail against you they will neither observe pacts nor good faith with you. They flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are averse to you, for most of them are iniquitous."
ENAA1244,QA1244,ENAA,1244,"They barter away the words of God for a petty price, and obstruct (others) from His path. How evil indeed are the things they do!"

ENAA1260,QA1260,ENAA,1260,"Indeed God has helped you on many occasions, even during the battle of Hunain, when you were elated with joy at your numbers which did not prove of the least avail, so that the earth and its vast expanse became too narrow for you, and you turned back and retreated."
ENAA1261,QA1261,ENAA,1261,Then God sent down a sense of tranquility on His Apostle and the faithful; and sent down troops invisible to punish the infidels. This is the recompense of those who do not believe.

ENAA1263,QA1263,ENAA,1263,"O believers, the idolaters are unclean. So they should not approach the Holy Mosque after this year. In case you fear indigence (from the stoppage of business with them), then God will enrich you of His bounty if He will, for God is all-knowing and all-wise."

ENAA1265,QA1265,ENAA,1265,"The Jews say: ""Ezra is the son of God;"" the Christians say: ""Christ is the son of God."" That is what they say with their tongues following assertions made by unbelievers before them. May they be damned by God: How perverse are they!"
ENAA1266,QA1266,ENAA,1266,"They consider their rabbis and monks and the Christ, son of Mary, to be gods apart from God, even though they had been enjoined to worship only one God, for there is no god but He. Too holy is He for what they ascribe to Him!"

ENAA1269,QA1269,ENAA,1269,"O believers, many rabbis and priests devour the possessions of others wrongfully, and keep men away from the path of God. To those who accumulate gold and silver, and do not spend in the way of God, announce the news of painful punishment."

ENAA1272,QA1272,ENAA,1272,"Intercalating a month is adding to unbelief. The unbelievers are misguided by this, for they take the same month to be sacred one year and sacrilegious the next, thus making the number of months sanctified by God accord with theirs in order to make what God has forbidden, lawful. Attractive seem to them their evil deeds; but God does not show the unbelievers the way."
ENAA1273,QA1273,ENAA,1273,"What has happened to you, O believers, that when you are asked to set out in the cause of God your feet begin to drag?

ENAA1274,QA1274,ENAA,1274,"Unless you go out (to strive), God will inflict grievous punishment on you, and bring other people in your place, and you will not be able to harm Him in the least, for God has the power over all things."
ENAA1275,QA1275,ENAA,1275,"If you do not help (the Prophet, remember) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave (and he was) one of two. When both of them were in the cave, he said to his companion: ""Do not grieve, for God is with us."" Then God sent divine peace on him, and invisible armies for his help, and made the unbelievers' purpose abject. Most exalted is God's word, for God is all-mighty and all-wise."

ENAA1278,QA1278,ENAA,1278,May God forgive you. Why did you allow them (to stay behind) without ascertaining who spoke the truth and who were liars?

ENAA1333,QA1333,ENAA,1333,"Some of these rustics take whatever they spend in the way of God as a penalty, and wait for an adverse turn in your fortune. For them will be the adverse change, as God hears all and knows everything."
ENAA1334,QA1334,ENAA,1334,"Yet some Arabs of the desert believe in God and the Last Day, and consider what they spend to be a means of bringing them nearer to God and the blessings of the Prophet. This is certainly a means of achieving nearness (to God), and God will admit them to His mercy, for God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA1335,QA1335,ENAA,1335,"Those among the migrants (from Makkah) and helpers (in Madina) who were the first to believe, and those who followed them in goodness, have been accepted by God and they follow His way.

ENAA1336,QA1336,ENAA,1336,"Some of the Arabs of the desert around you are hypocrites, and some of the people of Madina are stubborn in hypocrisy. You are not aware of them; We know them, and will punish them twice, and they will be sent to a harrowing doom."

Yet they will surely swear: ""We had only meant well."" But God is witness that they are liars."
ENAA1343,QA1343,ENAA,1343,Never set foot in that place. Only a mosque whose foundations have been laid from the very first on godliness is worthy of your visiting it. There you will find men who wish to be purified; and God loves those who are pure.

ENAA1346,QA1346,ENAA,1346,"God has verily bought the souls and possessions of the faithful in exchange for a promise of Paradise. They fight in the cause of God, and kill and are killed. This is a promise incumbent on Him, as in the Torah, so the Gospel and the Qur'an. And who is more true to his promise than God? So rejoice at the bargain you have made with Him; for this will be triumph supreme."
ENAA1347,QA1347,ENAA,1347,"To those who repent and pay homage, give praise and are devout, who kneel in prayer and bow in supplication, who enjoin good deeds and prohibit the bad, and keep to the limits set by God, announce the news of rejoicing to the faithful."
ENAA1348,QA1348,ENAA,1348,"It is not worthy of the Prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for those who are idolaters, even though they may be their relatives, after they have come to know that they are destined for Hell."
ENAA1349,QA1349,ENAA,1349,"As for Abraham's prayer for his father, he was fulfilling a promise he had made to him. Yet when it became evident to him that (his father) was an enemy of God, he broke away from him, though Abraham was soft hearted and kind."

ENAA1355,QA1355,ENAA,1355,"It was not worthy of the people of Madina, and the Arabs of the desert around them, to abandon the Prophet of God, and to care more for themselves than for him; for there is no hardship or thirst or hunger that they know in the service of God, and no place they walk on where walking provokes the unbelievers, and no harm they receive from the enemy, but is put down as a good deed in their favour. Surely God does not let the recompense of those who do good to go waste."
ENAA1356,QA1356,ENAA,1356,"There is not a sum, large or small, that they spend, not a piece of land that they traverse (in the service of God) which is not put down in their favour, so that God could reward them for what they had done."

ENAA1361,QA1361,ENAA,1361,Do they not know that they are tried every year once or twice? Even then they do not repent and take heed.
ENAA1362,QA1362,ENAA,1362,"Whenever a Surah is revealed they look at each other (so as to ask): ""Is anyone looking at Us?"" and then turn away. Indeed God has turned their hearts away (from the truth), for they cannot discern the law of heaven."

ENAA1369,QA1369,ENAA,1369,"It is He who gave the sun its radiance, the moon its lustre, and appointed its stations so that you may compute years and numbers. God did not create them but with deliberation. He distinctly explains His signs for those who can understand."

ENAA1377,QA1377,ENAA,1377,"How many generations did We lay low before you when they became wilfully unjust. Their apostles had brought clear proofs to them, yet they never believed. So We punished the sinful people."

ENAA1604,QA1604,ENAA,1604,"""Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we,"" (said his half brothers) ""even though we are a well-knit band. Our father is surely in the wrong."

ENAA1638,QA1638,ENAA,1638,"And (Joseph) asked the man he knew would be released: ""Remember me to your lord;"" but Satan made him forget to mention this to his lord, and Joseph remained in prison for a number of years."

ENAA1857,QA1857,ENAA,1857,"""We have given you the happy tidings of a truth,"" they replied. ""So do not be one of those who despair."""
ENAA1858,QA1858,ENAA,1858,"""Who would despair of the mercy of his Lord,"" he answered, ""but those who go astray."""
ENAA1859,QA1859,ENAA,1859,"And asked them: ""What matter, O angels, brings you here?"""

ENAA1874,QA1874,ENAA,1874,Verily by your life they were utterly confused in their (lustful) drunkenness.
ENAA1875,QA1875,ENAA,1875,So they were seized by the mighty blast at break of day;
ENAA1876,QA1876,ENAA,1876,"And We turned the city upside down, and rained on them stones of hardened lava."
ENAA1877,QA1877,ENAA,1877,Herein are really signs for those who discern.
ENAA1878,QA1878,ENAA,1878,This (city) lies on a road that still survives.
ENAA1879,QA1879,ENAA,1879,Indeed there is a portent in this for those who believe.
ENAA1880,QA1880,ENAA,1880,The dwellers of the Wood (near Midian) were also wicked.
ENAA1881,QA1881,ENAA,1881,"So We punished them too. They are both situated by the highway, clearly visible."
ENAA1882,QA1882,ENAA,1882,The people of Al-Hijr denied Our apostles;
ENAA1883,QA1883,ENAA,1883,And though We had given them Our signs they turned away from them.
ENAA1884,QA1884,ENAA,1884,They used to hew dwellings in the mountains to live in security.
ENAA1885,QA1885,ENAA,1885,But they were seized by the mighty blast towards the morning;
ENAA1886,QA1886,ENAA,1886,And all that they had done (for security) availed them nothing.
ENAA1887,QA1887,ENAA,1887,We have not created but with reason the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them. The Hour (of the great change) is certain to come. So turn away (from them) with a grace.
ENAA1888,QA1888,ENAA,1888,Surely your Lord is the Creator and knows (everything).
ENAA1889,QA1889,ENAA,1889,"We have indeed given you the seven oft-repeated (examples), and the majestic Qur'an."
ENAA1890,QA1890,ENAA,1890,"So covet not things We have bestowed on a portion of them to enjoy, and do not grieve for them, and protect those who believe;"

ENAA1894,QA1894,ENAA,1894,By your Lord We shall question them one and all

ENAA1896,QA1896,ENAA,1896,"So declare to them what We have enjoined, and turn away from idolaters."
ENAA1897,QA1897,ENAA,1897,"We are surely sufficient to deal with those who scoff at you,"
ENAA1898,QA1898,ENAA,1898,Who place other gods besides God. They will come to know soon.
ENAA1899,QA1899,ENAA,1899,We are well aware that you are disheartened by what they say.

ENAA1901,QA1901,ENAA,1901,And go on worshipping your Lord till the certainty (of death) comes upon you.
ENAA1902,QA1902,ENAA,1902,THE DECREE of GOD will surely come; so do not try to hasten it: Too glorious and high is He for what they associate with Him.
ENAA1903,QA1903,ENAA,1903,"He sends the angels with revelation by His command, to any of His creatures as He please, (saying): ""Warn that there is no god but I, so fear Me."""
ENAA1904,QA1904,ENAA,1904,He created the heavens and the earth with reason. Too glorious and high is He for what they associate with Him.
ENAA1905,QA1905,ENAA,1905,Man He created from a drop of semen; and still he becomes an open contender.
ENAA1906,QA1906,ENAA,1906,"He created the cattle from whom you get warm clothing and (other) advantages, and some you eat."
ENAA1907,QA1907,ENAA,1907,"There is life and cheer for you as you drive them home in the evening, and lead them out in the morning to graze."
ENAA1908,QA1908,ENAA,1908,They carry your burdens to lands so distant you could not have reached without much hardship. Indeed your Lord is compassionate and kind.
ENAA1909,QA1909,ENAA,1909,"He created horses, mules and donkeys for riding and for splendour. He created other things too which you do not know."
ENAA1910,QA1910,ENAA,1910,"To God leads the right path, though some deviate. If He willed He could guide you all to the right way."
ENAA1911,QA1911,ENAA,1911,"It is He who sends down water from the sky of which you drink, and which nourishes the plants you feed your cattle,"
ENAA1912,QA1912,ENAA,1912,"With which He makes crops grow, and olives, dates and grapes and fruits of every kind for you. In this is a sign for those who think."
ENAA1913,QA1913,ENAA,1913,"He harnessed the day and night for you, as also the sun, the moon and the stars, by His command. In this are signs for men who understand."
ENAA1914,QA1914,ENAA,1914,And other things of different shades has He produced on the earth for you. In this are signs for those who reflect.
ENAA1915,QA1915,ENAA,1915,"It is He who has subdued the sea that you may eat fresh meat from it, and obtain ornaments to wear. You see the ships plough through it that you may seek of His bounties and, perhaps, be grateful."
ENAA1916,QA1916,ENAA,1916,"He placed stablisers in the earth so that while it revolves you live undisturbed, and rivers and tracks so that you may find your way;"
ENAA1917,QA1917,ENAA,1917,"As well as many other signs, as by the stars (you) find direction."
ENAA1918,QA1918,ENAA,1918,"So, could one who creates be like one who cannot? Will you not then contemplate?"
ENAA1919,QA1919,ENAA,1919,If you count the favours of God you will not be able to calculate. Assuredly God is forgiving and kind.
ENAA1920,QA1920,ENAA,1920,God knows what you hide and disclose.
ENAA1921,QA1921,ENAA,1921,", As for those they call besides God, they cannot create a thing, and have themselves been created."
ENAA1922,QA1922,ENAA,1922,"Dead, without life they are, and do not know when they will be raised."
ENAA1923,QA1923,ENAA,1923,"Your God is one God. But the hearts of those who believe not in the life to come are filled with denial, and they are puffed up with pride."
ENAA1924,QA1924,ENAA,1924,Surely God knows what they hide and what they disclose. He certainly does not love the proud.
ENAA1925,QA1925,ENAA,1925,"For when they are asked: ""What has your Lord sent down?"" they say: ""Tales of long ago."""
ENAA1926,QA1926,ENAA,1926,"On the Day of Resurrection they will carry their own burden and some of the load of those they have led astray without any knowledge. Oh, how evil a burden they will carry!"
ENAA1927,QA1927,ENAA,1927,"Those who have gone before them had also conspired; then God uprooted their structure from its foundation; the roof fell over them from above, and punishment came upon them from somewhere they did not suspect."
ENAA1928,QA1928,ENAA,1928,"On the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and ask: ""Where are My compeers for whom you contended?"" Those endowed with knowledge will say: ""Shame and evil surely are for unbelievers today."""
ENAA1929,QA1929,ENAA,1929,"They whose souls are drawn out by the angels while they are sinning, shall offer submission: ""We did no evil."" But God knows well what you did."
ENAA1930,QA1930,ENAA,1930,"So enter the gates of Hell, and dwell there for ever. How dreadful a dwelling for the haughty!"
ENAA1931,QA1931,ENAA,1931,"When those who took heed for themselves would be asked: ""What did your Lord send down?"" They will answer: ""The best."" For those who do good there is good in the world, but certainly the abode of the next is better. How excellent the home of the virtuous!"
ENAA1932,QA1932,ENAA,1932,They will enter perennial gardens with streams of water and all they wish. Thus will the pious and devout be rewarded.
ENAA1933,QA1933,ENAA,1933,"When the angels receive the souls of those who are blameless they will say: ""Peace on you. Enter Paradise as recompense for what you did."""
ENAA1934,QA1934,ENAA,1934,"What! Do the (unbelievers) expect that the angels should descend, or the sentence of your Lord come to pass? So had the people done before them; yet God did not wrong them, they wronged themselves."
ENAA1935,QA1935,ENAA,1935,"The evil they perpetrated overtook them, and what they mocked has turned upon them."
ENAA1936,QA1936,ENAA,1936,"The idolaters say: ""If God had willed we would not have worshipped anything apart from Him, nor would our fathers have done, nor would we have forbidden any thing without His (leave)."" So had the people done before them. Therefore it is binding on the prophets to convey the message in clearest terms."
ENAA1937,QA1937,ENAA,1937,"To every community We have sent an apostle. (saying:) ""Worship God, and keep away from all other deities."" Thus some of them were guided by God, and ruin was justified on some. Travel over the earth and see what befell those who accused (the apostles) of lies."
ENAA1938,QA1938,ENAA,1938,"Even if you are eager to guide them, God does not surely guide those who have gone astray: They will have no one to help them."
ENAA1939,QA1939,ENAA,1939,"They swear emphatically in the name of God that God will not raise the dead. On the contrary, it is a promise incumbent on Him, though most men do not understand,"
ENAA1940,QA1940,ENAA,1940,"For (they fear) He might make what they differed about plain to them, and that the infidels may realise that they were liars."
ENAA1941,QA1941,ENAA,1941,"Yet when We will a thing We have only to say: ""Be"", and it is."
ENAA1942,QA1942,ENAA,1942,"Those who left their homes in the cause of God after having been oppressed, will be given by Us a better place in the world, and if they knew, the guerdon of the next would be greater"
ENAA1943,QA1943,ENAA,1943,(For) those who persevere and place their trust in their Lord.
ENAA1944,QA1944,ENAA,1944,"We sent before you none (as apostles) but men, to whom We sent revelations. In case you are unaware, enquire of those who are keepers of the Oracles of God."
ENAA1945,QA1945,ENAA,1945,We had Sent them with miracles and Books; and We have sent to you this Reminder so that you may explain distinctly to men what was sent down to them: They may haply reflect.
ENAA1946,QA1946,ENAA,1946,"Have the plotters of mischief become unafraid that God will not split the earth to swallow them, or that punishment will not fall upon them from somewhere they do not (even) suspect?"
ENAA1947,QA1947,ENAA,1947,"Or that He will not seize them as they move about, and they will not be able to elude (His grasp);"
ENAA1948,QA1948,ENAA,1948,Or He may seize them by diminishing their portion. Yet your Lord is compassionate and kind.
ENAA1949,QA1949,ENAA,1949,"Do they not see the shadows of all things God has created incline to the right and the left, bowing in obeisance to God?"
ENAA1950,QA1950,ENAA,1950,"All things that move on the earth and in the heavens, and the angels, bow in homage to God, and do not behave with pride."
ENAA1951,QA1951,ENAA,1951,"They have fear of God for His power over them, and act as commanded."
ENAA1952,QA1952,ENAA,1952,"God says: ""Do not take to two gods, for there is only one God. So fear Me."""
ENAA1953,QA1953,ENAA,1953,"Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and His the judgement for ever. So will you fear any other than God?"
ENAA1954,QA1954,ENAA,1954,"Whatsoever the blessings you enjoy are surely from God, and when in trouble you turn to Him in supplication."
ENAA1955,QA1955,ENAA,1955,"Yet when He has delivered you from affliction, some of you ascribe companions to your Lord"
ENAA1956,QA1956,ENAA,1956,"So as to deny what We have bestowed on them. Well, enjoy yourselves, you will come to know soon."
ENAA1957,QA1957,ENAA,1957,"They set aside a portion of the food We have given them for those they do not know. By God, you will surely have to answer for all you contrive!"
ENAA1958,QA1958,ENAA,1958,"They attribute daughters to God, the glorious, but for themselves whatsoever they please."
ENAA1959,QA1959,ENAA,1959,"Yet when news of the birth of a daughter reaches one of them, his face is darkened, and he is overwhelmed with silent grief,"
ENAA1960,QA1960,ENAA,1960,"And hides from people for shame at the news, (at a loss) whether he should keep her with shame, or bury her in the ground. How bad is the judgement that they make!"
ENAA1961,QA1961,ENAA,1961,"The semblance of those who believe not in the life to come is that of the meanest; but the semblance of God is the most sublime, for He is all-mighty and all-wise."
ENAA1962,QA1962,ENAA,1962,"If God were to punish men for their inequity He would not leave a single moving thing on earth. Yet He gives them latitude for a time ordained. When that time is come, there will not be a moment's delay nor a moment's haste."
ENAA1963,QA1963,ENAA,1963,"Yet they attribute to God what they find detestable; and their tongues assert the lie that for them is only good. On the contrary, there is Fire for them, and they will be thrown into it."
ENAA1964,QA1964,ENAA,1964,"By God, We sent apostles to many a people before you, but Satan made their acts seem attractive to them, and he is their friend this day, and a painful torment awaits them."
ENAA1965,QA1965,ENAA,1965,"We have sent down this Book to you that you may explain to them what it is that they are differing about, and as guidance and a grace for those who believe."
ENAA1966,QA1966,ENAA,1966,God sends down water from the skies and quickens the dead earth to a new birth. Here is a sign for those who listen.
ENAA1967,QA1967,ENAA,1967,And surely in cattle there is a lesson for you: We give you a drink from the extract of food in their bellies and blood-purest milk so delicious to drink;
ENAA1968,QA1968,ENAA,1968,"And in fruits of the date-palm and the vine, from which you obtain inebriating drinks and excellent food. In this indeed are signs for those who understand."
ENAA1969,QA1969,ENAA,1969,"Your Lord predisposed the bees to make their hives in mountains, trees and trellices,"
ENAA1970,QA1970,ENAA,1970,And suck from all fruits and flit about the unrestricted paths of their Lord. A drink of various hues comes out of their bellies which contains medicine for men. In this is a sign for those who reflect.
ENAA1971,QA1971,ENAA,1971,"It is God who creates you, then makes you die; and some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they had known before. God is indeed all-knowing and all-powerful."
ENAA1972,QA1972,ENAA,1972,God has favoured some of you over others in the means of subsistence. But those who have been favoured with more do not give of their means to their dependents so that they may become equal with them. Do they then deny God's beneficence?
ENAA1973,QA1973,ENAA,1973,"God has provided mates for you of your own kind, and has bestowed on you sons and daughters from your mates, and has given you good things for food. Will they even then believe in the false and deny God's grace?"
ENAA1974,QA1974,ENAA,1974,"Yet they worship those apart from God who cannot provide for them any sustenance from the heavens or the earth, nor will they have power to do so."
ENAA1975,QA1975,ENAA,1975,"So do not invent similitudes for God. Indeed God knows, and you do not know."
ENAA1976,QA1976,ENAA,1976,"God presents the example of a man who is a hired servant with no power over anything, and another on whom We have bestowed a handsome fortune, who spends from it in private and in public: Can they be equal? Praised be God! But most men do not understand."
ENAA1977,QA1977,ENAA,1977,"God presents another example of two men, one dumb and unable to do a thing and is a burden on his master. Wherever he is sent he returns without any good (result). Could he be equal to one who enjoins what is just, and follows the right path?"
ENAA1978,QA1978,ENAA,1978,"To God belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and the Hour of Doom is a matter of the winking of an eye, even less, for God has certainly power over all things."
ENAA1979,QA1979,ENAA,1979,"God produced you from your mothers' wombs knowing nothing, but gave you ears and eyes and hearts so that you may be grateful."
ENAA1980,QA1980,ENAA,1980,Do you not see the birds held high between the heavens and the earth? Nothing holds them (aloft) but God. There are verily signs in this for those who believe.
ENAA1981,QA1981,ENAA,1981,"God has given you homes to live in, and tents (made) from the hides of cattle convenient for days of travelling and halting; and from their wool and fur and hair you make domestic articles and goods that last a certain time."
ENAA1982,QA1982,ENAA,1982,"God has given you of things created, shade, and places of shelter in the mountains, and clothes for protection against the heat, and coats (of mail) for defence during war. He thus bestows His favours on you so that you may be grateful to Him."
ENAA1983,QA1983,ENAA,1983,"If they still turn away, your duty is to warn them in clear terms."
ENAA1984,QA1984,ENAA,1984,"They do know the favours of God, and yet they deny them, for most of them are not grateful."
ENAA1985,QA1985,ENAA,1985,"The day We shall call a witness from every people, the unbelievers will not be allowed to make excuses."
ENAA1986,QA1986,ENAA,1986,"And when the wicked shall face the torment it will not be decreased, nor will they be reprieved."
ENAA1987,QA1987,ENAA,1987,"When the idolaters see their partners they will call out: ""O our Lord, these are the partners we invoked instead of You;"" but they will retort: ""You are liars."""
ENAA1988,QA1988,ENAA,1988,"They will offer submission to God that Day, and the lies they fabricated will not be of the least avail."
ENAA1989,QA1989,ENAA,1989,"For those who deny the truth and obstruct (others) from the way of God, We shall add torment to torment as they were perpetrating corruption."
ENAA1990,QA1990,ENAA,1990,"Remind them of the Day when We shall call from every people a witness against them, and make you a witness over them, for We have revealed to you the Book as an exposition of everything, and as guidance and grace and happy tidings for those who submit."
ENAA1991,QA1991,ENAA,1991,"Verily God has enjoined justice, the doing of good, and the giving of gifts to your relatives; and forbidden indecency, impropriety and oppression. He warns you so that you may remember."
ENAA1992,QA1992,ENAA,1992,"Fulfil your covenant with God, having made the covenant, and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them, as you have made God a witness over you. Indeed God knows what you do."
ENAA1993,QA1993,ENAA,1993,And do not be like her who untwists her yarn having spun it into durable thread. Do not use your oaths deceitfully because one party has ascendency over you. God surely tries you in this way: He will make it clear to you on the Day of Resurrection what you were differing about.
ENAA1994,QA1994,ENAA,1994,"If God had pleased He would surely have made you a single community of belief; but He leads whosoever He wills astray, and guides whosoever He please. But you will surely be questioned about what you used to do."
ENAA1995,QA1995,ENAA,1995,"So do not make your oaths a means of deceiving one another, lest your foot should slip after having found its hold, and you taste of evil for having hindered (others) from the way of God, and suffer a grievous punishment."
ENAA1996,QA1996,ENAA,1996,"And do not trade God's covenant for a paltry price. Remember, what is with God is better for you, if only you knew!"
ENAA1997,QA1997,ENAA,1997,"For what you possess will pass, but what is with God will abide. We shall certainly award those who persevere a recompense in keeping with their deeds."
ENAA1998,QA1998,ENAA,1998,"We shall invest whosoever works for good, whether man or woman, with a pleasant life, and reward them in accordance with the best of what they have done."
ENAA1999,QA1999,ENAA,1999,"So, when you recite the Qur'an seek refuge in God from Satan the execrable."
ENAA2000,QA2000,ENAA,2000,He does not have power over those who believe and place their trust in their Lord.
ENAA2001,QA2001,ENAA,2001,"His power is only over those who take him as their patron, and those who ascribe equals (to God)."
ENAA2002,QA2002,ENAA,2002,"When We replace a message with another -- and God knows best what He reveals -- they say: ""You have made it up;"" yet most of them do not know."
ENAA2003,QA2003,ENAA,2003,"You say: ""It has been sent by divine grace from your Lord with truth to strengthen those who believe, and as guidance and good news for those who have submitted (to God)."""
ENAA2004,QA2004,ENAA,2004,"Yet We know what they say: ""It is only a man who instructs him."" The speech of the man they imply is obscure while this is clear Arabic."
ENAA2005,QA2005,ENAA,2005,Those who do not believe in the words of God are verily not guided by God. For them is severe punishment.
ENAA2006,QA2006,ENAA,2006,"They alone invent lies who do not believe in the words of God, and they are liars."
ENAA2007,QA2007,ENAA,2007,"Whosoever denies having once believed -- unless he is forced to do so while his heart enjoys the peace of faith -- and opens his mind to disbelief will suffer the wrath of God. Their punishment will be great,"
ENAA2008,QA2008,ENAA,2008,For they loved the life of this world more than the life to come; and God does not guide those who do not believe.
ENAA2009,QA2009,ENAA,2009,They are the ones whose hearts and ears and eyes have been sealed by God; and these are the heedless.
ENAA2010,QA2010,ENAA,2010,"They will surely be losers in the life to come,"

ENAA2563,QA2563,ENAA,2563,And We taught him the art of making coats of mail to shield you from each other's violence. Will you not be grateful even then?
ENAA2564,QA2564,ENAA,2564,We made tempestuous winds obedient to Solomon which blew swiftly to sail at his bidding (with his ships) to the land We had blessed. We are cognisant of everything.

ENAA2620,QA2620,ENAA,2620,"As for those who disbelieve, and obstruct the way of God and the holy Mosque which We have set down for all men, the native and the visitor alike. Whoever puts obstructions in this mischievously will taste of painful punishment."

ENAA2626,QA2626,ENAA,2626,Turn uprightly to God without ascribing compeers to Him; for he who associates any one with God is like a thing that falls from the sky and is either snatched away by birds or carried far away by the wind.

ENAA2631,QA2631,ENAA,2631,"We have made the camels signs of God for you. There is good for you in this. So pronounce the name of God over them as they stand with their forefeet in a line. When they have fallen (slaughtered) on their sides, eat of (their meat) and feed those who are content with little, and those who supplicate. That is why We have brought them under your subjugation so that you may be grateful."

ENAA2639,QA2639,ENAA,2639,And the people of Midian too. Moses was also accused of lies. So I allowed the infidels respite and then seized them. How was My reprobation then!

ENAA2684,QA2684,ENAA,2684,"Who will inherit Paradise, and live in it for ever."
ENAA2685,QA2685,ENAA,2685,"We created man from the finest extract of clay,"
ENAA2686,QA2686,ENAA,2686,Then We placed him as a sperm in a firmly established lodging;
ENAA2687,QA2687,ENAA,2687,"Then We fashioned the sperm into an embryo, then fashioned the embryo into a shapeless lump of flesh; then from the lump of flesh We fashioned bones, then clothed the bones with flesh. Thus We formed him into a new creation. So blessed be God the best of Creators."
ENAA2688,QA2688,ENAA,2688,"And then you will certainly die,"
ENAA2689,QA2689,ENAA,2689,Then will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection.
ENAA2690,QA2690,ENAA,2690,We made several highways one over the other above you. We are not neglectful of creation.

ENAA2696,QA2696,ENAA,2696,"We sent Noah to his people. He said: ""O my people, worship God, for you have no other god but He. Will you not take heed for yourselves?"""
ENAA2697,QA2697,ENAA,2697,"The chiefs of his people, who did not believe, said: ""He is only a man like you. He wishes to acquire ascendancy over you. If God had willed He would have sent down angels. We never heard this from our elders."

ENAA2700,QA2700,ENAA,2700,"So We asked him to build the ark under Our eyes and guidance, (and said): ""When Our command is issued and the source of water boils over, put a pair of every species in it, and your family except those for whom Our sentence has been passed already; and do not speak to Me for those who are wicked: They will be drowned."
ENAA2701,QA2701,ENAA,2701,"When you and those with you have boarded the ark, say: 'All praise be to God who has delivered us from the people who were sinful.'"

ENAA2703,QA2703,ENAA,2703,There were surely signs in this; We will surely put you to the test.
ENAA2704,QA2704,ENAA,2704,After them We raised a new generation.
ENAA2705,QA2705,ENAA,2705,"Then We sent to them an apostle from among them (who said): ""Worship God, for you have no other god but He. Will you not take heed and fear God?"""
ENAA2706,QA2706,ENAA,2706,"The chiefs of the people who did not believe and denied the life to come, though We had given them good things of this life to enjoy, (said): ""He is only a mortal like you. He eats as you do, and drinks as you drink."
ENAA2707,QA2707,ENAA,2707,So if you follow a man like yourself you will certainly be doomed.
ENAA2708,QA2708,ENAA,2708,"Does he give you a promise that when you are dead and turned to dust and bones, you will be raised to life again?"
ENAA2709,QA2709,ENAA,2709,How far-fetched what you are promised;
ENAA2710,QA2710,ENAA,2710,There is only the life of this world: We die and we live: there is no rising from the dead for us.
ENAA2711,QA2711,ENAA,2711,"He is just a man who invents a lie about God; we cannot believe in him."""

ENAA2713,QA2713,ENAA,2713,"Answered (the Lord): ""They shall wake up repenting soon."""

ENAA2715,QA2715,ENAA,2715,Then after them We raised other generations.
ENAA2716,QA2716,ENAA,2716,"No nation can live beyond its allotted time, or lag behind."
ENAA2717,QA2717,ENAA,2717,"Then We sent Our apostles one after the other. Every time an apostle came to a people they denied him. So We made one follow the other (to its doom), and turned them into bygone tales. Cursed be the people who do not believe!"
ENAA2718,QA2718,ENAA,2718,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our miracles and clear proofs
ENAA2719,QA2719,ENAA,2719,"To Pharaoh and his nobles who behaved with arrogance, for they were a conceited lot,"
ENAA2720,QA2720,ENAA,2720,"And said: ""Should we believe in two men like yourselves, whose people are our subjects?"""

ENAA2722,QA2722,ENAA,2722,And We gave the Book to Moses so that they may be guided.
ENAA2723,QA2723,ENAA,2723,"And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them shelter on an elevated ground, sequestered, watered by a spring."
ENAA2724,QA2724,ENAA,2724,"O you apostles, eat things that are clean, and do things that are good. We are surely cognisant of what you do."

ENAA2727,QA2727,ENAA,2727,So leave them to their ignorance for a time.
ENAA2728,QA2728,ENAA,2728,Do they think that by increasing their wealth and children
ENAA2729,QA2729,ENAA,2729,We are hastening to reward them for good deeds? No. They do not comprehend.

ENAA2734,QA2734,ENAA,2734,Are the ones who hasten to goodness and outpace the others.
ENAA2735,QA2735,ENAA,2735,"We do not burden a soul beyond capacity, for We have a record that tells the truth. No wrong will be done to any one."

ENAA2743,QA2743,ENAA,2743,"Or do they say that he is possessed? In fact, he has brought the truth to them, but most of them abhor the truth."
ENAA2744,QA2744,ENAA,2744,"Had truth been subject to their whims the heavens and the earth and all those within them would have been depraved. In fact We had sent them their reminder, but they turned away from good advice."

ENAA2826,QA2826,ENAA,2826,"God is the light of the heavens and the earth. The semblance of His light is that of a niche in which is a lamp, the flame within a glass, the glass a glittering star as it were, lit with the oil of a blessed tree, the olive, neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil appears to light up even though fire touches it not, -- light upon light. God guides to His light whom He will. So does God advance precepts of wisdom for men, for God has knowledge of everything."

Then you see the rain fall through them; and He sends down hail from the sky where there are mountains of it, and strikes those with it whom He will, and wards it off from whomsoever He please. His lightning could snatch away their eyes."
ENAA2835,QA2835,ENAA,2835,It is God who alternates night and day. There is surely a lesson in this for men of sight.

God thus explains things to you clearly, for God is all-knowing and all-wise."
ENAA2850,QA2850,ENAA,2850,"When your children have reached the age of puberty, they should similarly ask your leave (for entering) as others did before them. God thus clearly explains His commands to you, for God is all-knowing and all-wise."

ENAA2853,QA2853,ENAA,2853,"There is no harm in your eating together or separately. But when you enter the houses, salute the inmates with a greeting in the name of God, invoking blessings and good health. That is how God explains things to you clearly so that you may understand. They alone are true believers who believe in God and His Apostle, and when they are with him on a matter of common concern, do not depart without obtaining his leave. Surely those who ask leave of you are the ones who believe in God and His Apostle. Therefore when they ask leave of you for personal business give leave to those you please, and seek God's forgiveness for them. Surely God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA2854,QA2854,ENAA,2854,Do not consider your being summoned by the Apostle to be like your summoning one another. God knows those of you who go away surreptitiously.

ENAA3414,QA3414,ENAA,3414,"In the help of God. He helps whom He will; He is all-mighty, ever-merciful."
ENAA3415,QA3415,ENAA,3415,It is a promise of God; and God does not go back on His promise. Yet most men do not understand:
ENAA3416,QA3416,ENAA,3416,"They only know the palpable life of this world, and are oblivious of the Hereafter."
ENAA3417,QA3417,ENAA,3417,Do they not think for themselves that God did not create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them without reason and a determined purpose? But many men reject the meeting with their Lord.
ENAA3418,QA3418,ENAA,3418,"Have they not travelled on the earth and seen how the others before them had met their end? They were far more powerful than them, furrowed the earth and colonised it far more than they; and their apostles came to them with visible signs. It was surely not for God to wrong them, they wronged themselves."
ENAA3419,QA3419,ENAA,3419,"Therefore evil was the end of those who did evil, for they denied the signs of God and made fun of them."
ENAA3420,QA3420,ENAA,3420,"God originates creation, and then will revert it, then you will go back to Him."
ENAA3421,QA3421,ENAA,3421,The day the Resurrection comes the sinners will be overwhelmed with despair.
ENAA3422,QA3422,ENAA,3422,"No intercessor will they have among those they associated (with God), and will reject their partners."
ENAA3423,QA3423,ENAA,3423,The day the Hour comes they will be separated into categories.
ENAA3424,QA3424,ENAA,3424,"Those who believed and did the right will be feasted in a rich, well-watered meadow."
ENAA3425,QA3425,ENAA,3425,"Those who did not believe and rejected Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter, will be given over to punishment."
ENAA3426,QA3426,ENAA,3426,"So extol God when the evening comes and the day dawns,"
ENAA3427,QA3427,ENAA,3427,"For His is the praise in the heavens and the earth, -- and at nightfall and the time of noon."
ENAA3428,QA3428,ENAA,3428,"He brings the living from the dead, the dead from the living, and quickens the earth after it had died. So will you be brought forth (from the dead)."
ENAA3429,QA3429,ENAA,3429,"Among His signs is that He created you from the earth, and you are now human beings dispersed everywhere."
ENAA3430,QA3430,ENAA,3430,"Another of His signs is that He created mates of your own kind of yourselves so that you may get peace of mind from them, and has put love and compassion between you. Verily there are signs in this for those who reflect."
ENAA3431,QA3431,ENAA,3431,"Among other signs of His is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variety of your tongues and complexions. Surely there are signs in this for those who understand."
ENAA3432,QA3432,ENAA,3432,"Another of His signs is the night, a time for you to sleep, and the day to seek His bounty. Verily there are signs in this for those who pay heed."
ENAA3433,QA3433,ENAA,3433,"Another of His signs is the lightning He shows to fill you both with dread and hope, and the water He sends down from the sky which reawakens the earth that was dead. There are indeed signs in this for those who have sense."
ENAA3434,QA3434,ENAA,3434,Another of His signs is that the heavens and the earth stay in position by His command; and then when He will call you once you will come out of the earth.
ENAA3435,QA3435,ENAA,3435,"All those who are in the heavens and the earth are His, and they are all obedient to Him."
ENAA3436,QA3436,ENAA,3436,It is He who first creates and then reverts it. This is how His law works inevitably. His semblance is of the most sublime in the heavens and the earth. He is all-mighty and all-wise.
ENAA3437,QA3437,ENAA,3437,"He gives you an example from your own life: Do you possess among your dependants any partners in what We have bestowed on you, so that you and they have equal (share) in it, and that you fear them as you fear each other? That is how We explain Our signs clearly for those who comprehend."
ENAA3438,QA3438,ENAA,3438,And yet the wicked follow their own lusts without understanding. Who can show the way to those whom God allows to go astray? None will they have to help them.
ENAA3439,QA3439,ENAA,3439,"So keep yourself exclusively on the true way, the creational law of God according to which He created man with the quality of choosing right or wrong. There is no altering of God's creation. This is the supreme law. But most men do not understand."
ENAA3440,QA3440,ENAA,3440,"Turn towards Him and be dutiful to Him; be firm in devotion, and do not become an idolater,"
ENAA3441,QA3441,ENAA,3441,"(Or) one of those who created rifts in their order and are divided into sects, with each group exulting in what it has (carved out for itself) --"
ENAA3442,QA3442,ENAA,3442,When misfortune befalls men they pray to their Lord and turn to Him; but afterwards when He has given them a taste of His benevolence a section of them begins to ascribe compeers to their Lord
ENAA3443,QA3443,ENAA,3443,So as to deny what We have given them. Please yourselves for a time; you will come to know soon.
ENAA3444,QA3444,ENAA,3444,Have We sent down a charter to them which mentions what they associate with Him?
ENAA3445,QA3445,ENAA,3445,"When We give men a taste of Our benevolence they start rejoicing in it. When misfortune befalls them as a result of what they have done themselves, they begin to despair."
ENAA3446,QA3446,ENAA,3446,Do they not see God increases or decreases the means of whosoever He please? Verily there are signs in this for those who believe.
ENAA3447,QA3447,ENAA,3447,"So, give their share to the relatives, the needy, and the wayfarers. This is best for those who seek the way that leads to God, and they will be successful."
ENAA3448,QA3448,ENAA,3448,"What you give on interest to increase (your capital) through others' wealth, does not find increase with God; yet what you give (in alms and charity) with a pure heart, seeking the way of God, will be doubled."
ENAA3449,QA3449,ENAA,3449,"It is God who created you, then gave you sustenance, then He will make you die, and bring you back to life. Is there one among those you associate with Him who can do the least of these things? Too high and exalted is He for what they associate with Him!"
ENAA3450,QA3450,ENAA,3450,Corruption has spread over land and sea from what men have done themselves that they may taste a little of what they have done: They may haply come back (to the right path).
ENAA3451,QA3451,ENAA,3451,"Say: ""Travel on the earth and see how came the end of those before you."" Most of them were idolaters."
ENAA3452,QA3452,ENAA,3452,So set your face towards the straight path before the day arrives from God which is irreversible. Men will be segregated on that day.
ENAA3453,QA3453,ENAA,3453,"So that he who disbelieves will bear the consequence of his unbelief; and he who does the right will straighten out the way for himself,"
ENAA3454,QA3454,ENAA,3454,"So that God may reward those who believed and did what was good, by His grace. Surely He does not love unbelievers."
ENAA3455,QA3455,ENAA,3455,"Among His signs are the breezes He sends as harbingers of happy news, so that He may allow you to taste of His mercy, and that ships may sail by His command, and you may seek of His bounty, and may haply be grateful."
ENAA3456,QA3456,ENAA,3456,"Verily We sent many apostles before you to their people, who brought clear signs with them. Then We retributed those who were sinful. It is a duty incumbent on Us to help the believers."
ENAA3457,QA3457,ENAA,3457,"It is God who sends the breezes that raise clouds, then spreads them over the sky as He please, fold on fold, then you see the drops of rain issue from between them. When He sends it down to those of His creatures as He will, they are filled with joy,"
ENAA3458,QA3458,ENAA,3458,Although before it came down they were despondent.
ENAA3459,QA3459,ENAA,3459,So consider the signs of His benevolence: How He quickens the earth after it had become waste. He is verily the one who will raise the dead. He has power over everything.
ENAA3460,QA3460,ENAA,3460,"If We send a (blighting) wind and they see (the earth) seared autumnal, they would surely become ungrateful."
ENAA3461,QA3461,ENAA,3461,"You cannot make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they have turned back and retreated,"
ENAA3462,QA3462,ENAA,3462,Nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray. You can make none hear except those who believe Our signs and have come to submission.
ENAA3463,QA3463,ENAA,3463,"It is God who created you of weakness, then after weakness gave you strength, then after strength will give you weakness and grey hair. Surely He makes whatever He wills. He is all-knowing and all-powerful."
ENAA3464,QA3464,ENAA,3464,"The day Resurrection is set the sinners will swear: ""We did not tarry more than an hour (and cannot be guilty)."" That is how they have always been deceived."
ENAA3465,QA3465,ENAA,3465,"But those who were given the knowledge and belief will say: ""You have tarried, according to the Book of God, as long as the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection, but 'you do not know."""
ENAA3466,QA3466,ENAA,3466,"Their excuses will be of no avail to the sinners on that day, and they will not be allowed to beg for favour."
ENAA3467,QA3467,ENAA,3467,"We have offered every kind of example here in this Qur'an to men. Even then if you bring a verse to them, those who disbelieve say: ""You are nothing but a liar."""
ENAA3468,QA3468,ENAA,3468,That is how God seals the hearts of those who do not know.
ENAA3469,QA3469,ENAA,3469,So have patience. The promise of God is surely true; and let not those who do not believe make you relax (your endeavours).

ENAA3471,QA3471,ENAA,3471,"These are the verses of the sagacious Book,"

ENAA3473,QA3473,ENAA,3473,"Who are constant in devotion, pay the zakat, and are certain of the Hereafter."
ENAA3474,QA3474,ENAA,3474,"They are on guidance from their Lord, and will prosper."
ENAA3475,QA3475,ENAA,3475,"But among men are also those who spread frivolous stories to mislead (others) from the way of God, without any knowledge, and take it lightly. For such as these the nemesis will be shameful."
ENAA3476,QA3476,ENAA,3476,"When Our verses are recited before them they turn away haughtily as though they did not hear them, as if a deafness had come into their ears. So give them tidings of a shameful punishment."
ENAA3477,QA3477,ENAA,3477,Surely for those who believe and do the right are pleasure gardens.

ENAA3479,QA3479,ENAA,3479,"He created the skies without a support, as you can see, and placed stabilisers in the earth that you may dwell at ease as it revolves; and dispersed on it all varieties of creatures, and He sent down water from the skies and grew all kinds of splendid things upon it."
ENAA3480,QA3480,ENAA,3480,Such is God's creation. Show me now what those (they worship) beside Him have created. Surely the evil-doers are in clear error.
ENAA3481,QA3481,ENAA,3481,"We bestowed wisdom on Luqman that he may be grateful to God. Whosoever is grateful is so for his own good, and whoever is ungrateful (should remember) that God is above all concern, worthy of praise."

ENAA3555,QA3555,ENAA,3555,"When the faithful saw (the armies of) the allied tribes, they said: ""This is what God and His Apostle had promised us; and God and His Apostle say the truth;"" and this enhanced their faith and obedience."

ENAA3566,QA3566,ENAA,3566,"Stay at home, and do not deck yourselves with ostentation as in the days of paganism; fulfil your devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey God and His Apostle.

ENAA3569,QA3569,ENAA,3569,No believing men and women have any choice in a matter after God and His Apostle have decided it. Whoever disobeys God and His Apostle has clearly lost the way and gone astray.
ENAA3570,QA3570,ENAA,3570,"When you said to him who had been favoured by God and was favoured by you: ""Keep your wife to yourself and fear God,"" you were hiding something God was about to bring to light, for you had fear of men, though you should fear God more. And when Zaid was through with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that it may not remain a sin for the faithful (to marry) the wives of their adopted sons when they are through with them. God's command is to be fulfilled."
ENAA3571,QA3571,ENAA,3571,"There is no constraint on the Prophet in what God has decreed for him. This has been the way of God with (apostles) who have gone before you, and God's command is a determined act."

ENAA3582,QA3582,ENAA,3582,"O you who believe, when you marry believing women then divorce them before having (sexual) contact with them, you have no right to demand observance of the 'waiting period' of them. But provide suitably for them, and let them go with honour."
ENAA3583,QA3583,ENAA,3583,"We have made lawful for you, O Prophet, wives to whom you have given their dower, and God-given maids and captives you have married, and the daughters of your father's brothers and daughters of your father's sisters, and daughters of your mother's brothers and sisters, who migrated with you; and a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet if the Prophet desires to marry her. This is a privilege only for you and not the other believers. We know what We have ordained for them about their wives and maids they possess, so that you may be free of blame, for God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA3584,QA3584,ENAA,3584,"You may defer the turn of any of your wives you like, and may take any other you desire. There is no harm if you take any of those (whose turn) you had deferred. This would be better as it would gladden their hearts and they will not grieve, and each will be happy with what you have given her. God knows what is in your heart, for He is all-wise and benign."
ENAA3585,QA3585,ENAA,3585,"No other women are lawful for you after this except those you have married, nor to change your present wives for other women even though their beauty should appeal to you. God is watchful of everything."
ENAA3586,QA3586,ENAA,3586,"O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without awaiting the proper time, unless asked, and enter when you are invited, and depart when you have eaten, and do not stay on talking. This puts the Prophet to inconvenience, and he feels embarrassed before you; but God is not embarrassed in (saying) the truth. And when you ask his wife for some thing of utility, ask for it from behind the screen. This is for the purity of your hearts and theirs. It does not behove you to annoy the prophet of God, or to ever marry his wives after him. This would indeed be serious in the sight of God."
ENAA3587,QA3587,ENAA,3587,"Whether you discuss a thing or conceal it, surely God has knowledge of everything."
ENAA3588,QA3588,ENAA,3588,"There is no harm if they come before their fathers or their sons, or their brothers and their brothers' and sisters' sons, or their women folk or captive maids they possess. Follow the commands of God. Verily God is witness to everything."
ENAA3589,QA3589,ENAA,3589,"God and His angels shower their blessings on the Prophet. O believers, you should also send your blessings on him, and salute him with a worthy greeting."
ENAA3590,QA3590,ENAA,3590,Those who offend God and His Prophet will be damned in this world and the next. There is a shameful punishment ready for them.
ENAA3591,QA3591,ENAA,3591,"Those who slander believing men and women for what they have not done, will bear the burden of calumny and clear iniquity."
ENAA3592,QA3592,ENAA,3592,"O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and the women of the faithful, to draw their wraps a little over them. They will thus be recognised and no harm will come to them. God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA3593,QA3593,ENAA,3593,"If the hypocrites and perverts, and the rumour-mongers of Madinah, do not desist even now, We shall rouse you against them, so they would not be able to live but a short time in the city with you."

ENAA3602,QA3602,ENAA,3602,"O you who believe, do not be like those who maligned Moses, whilst God cleared him of what they alleged; and he was held in high esteem with God."
ENAA3603,QA3603,ENAA,3603,"O you who believe, obey the commands of God, and say straightforward things"
ENAA3604,QA3604,ENAA,3604,That He may straighten your affairs for you and forgive your sins; and he who obeys God and His Prophet will be successful.
ENAA3605,QA3605,ENAA,3605,"We had offered the Trust (of divine responsibilities) to the heavens, the earth, the mountains, but they refrained from bearing the burden and were frightened of it; but man took it on himself. He is a faithless ignoramus."
ENAA3606,QA3606,ENAA,3606,"So that God punishes men and women hypocrites, the idolaters and idolatrous women, but He turns to faithful men and women in forgiveness, for God is forgiving and kind."

ENAA3680,QA3680,ENAA,3680,"Nor darkness and light,"
ENAA3681,QA3681,ENAA,3681,Nor shade and heat of sunshine.
ENAA3682,QA3682,ENAA,3682,Equal are not the living and the dead. Verily God makes those He will to listen; but you cannot make those hear who are in their graves.
ENAA3683,QA3683,ENAA,3683,You are only a bearer of warnings.
ENAA3684,QA3684,ENAA,3684,"We have sent you with the truth, to give glad tidings and to warn. Never has there been a community to which an admonisher was not sent."
ENAA3685,QA3685,ENAA,3685,"If they call you a liar, so had those before them called their apostles liars, who had come to them with clear proofs, scriptures and the splendent Book."
ENAA3686,QA3686,ENAA,3686,So We seized the unbelievers. How great was the change I wrought in their condition then!
ENAA3687,QA3687,ENAA,3687,"Do you not see how God sends water from the sky, then We produce fruits from it variegated in colour; and on mountains are tracts of red and white, in different shades and raven black."
ENAA3688,QA3688,ENAA,3688,"And so are among men, beasts and cattle, different shades. Only those of His creatures fear God who have knowledge. Verily He is all-mighty and forgiving."
ENAA3689,QA3689,ENAA,3689,"Surely those who read the Book of God, are firm in devotion, and spend of what We have given them in secret or openly, can hope for a commerce that will not decline,"
ENAA3690,QA3690,ENAA,3690,"So that He may reward them in full, and give them a greater increase by His grace. He is verily forgiving and rewarding."
ENAA3691,QA3691,ENAA,3691,"What We have revealed to you of the Book is the truth, and proves (what has been sent) before it to be true. Verily God is informed of His creatures and sees everything."
ENAA3692,QA3692,ENAA,3692,"So We made those of Our creatures whom We had chosen, heirs to the Book; but some of these exceed themselves, and some follow the middle course, and some surpass others in goodness by God's will, which is the greatest blessing."
ENAA3693,QA3693,ENAA,3693,"They will enter the gardens of Eden, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and of silk will be their garments."
ENAA3694,QA3694,ENAA,3694,"They will say: ""All praise be to God who has removed all care from us. Indeed our Lord is forgiving and rewarding,"
ENAA3695,QA3695,ENAA,3695,"Who has settled us by His grace in the mansions of eternal rest, where there is no labour for us, nor does weariness come upon us."""
ENAA3696,QA3696,ENAA,3696,"As for the unbelievers, there is the fire of Hell. It will neither consume them wholly that they should die, nor will its torment be lessened for them. That is how We requite the ungrateful."
ENAA3697,QA3697,ENAA,3697,"There they will cry for help: ""O Lord, get us out that we may do the right, and not what we used to do."" Did We not give you a long enough span of life so that he who remembered may reflect? And did not the warner come to you? So now taste (the punishment). The iniquitous will have none to help them."
ENAA3698,QA3698,ENAA,3698,Verily God knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth. Indeed He knows what lies in the hearts of men.
ENAA3699,QA3699,ENAA,3699,"He is the one who made you trustees on the earth. So he who disbelieves, will bear the consequence of his unbelief. but their unbelief will only increase disgust for unbelievers in the sight of their Lord; and their unbelief will only lead the unbelievers to greater loss."
ENAA3700,QA3700,ENAA,3700,"Say: ""Look at the compeers you invoke apart from God. Show me, what of the earth have they created, or what share have they in the heavens?"" Or have We given them a Book whose testimony they possess? Not in the least. What the unbelievers have been promising one another is nothing but deceit."
ENAA3701,QA3701,ENAA,3701,"Verily God holds the heavens and the earth in position lest they deviate; and if they deviated there will be none to hold them in place, apart from Him He is sagacious and forgiving."
ENAA3702,QA3702,ENAA,3702,"The unbelievers swore on oath emphatically that if an admonisher came to them they would be guided better than the other communities. But when the admonisher came to them their aversion for the truth increased,"
ENAA3703,QA3703,ENAA,3703,"As did their arrogance in the land, and their plotting of evil. But their evil plots will turn back on the plotters themselves. So can they expect any thing but what befell the earlier people? You will not find any change in the law of God, nor will you find divine law mutable."
ENAA3704,QA3704,ENAA,3704,"Have they not journeyed in the land and seen how the end of those before them, who were far more powerful, came about? There is nothing in the heavens and the earth that can defeat (the law of) God. He is all-knowing and all-powerful."
ENAA3705,QA3705,ENAA,3705,"If God were to seize men for their doings, not a living being would be left upon the earth. But He gives them respite for a time ordained. When their time is come, surely God will keep (the interest of) His creatures in view."
ENAA3706,QA3706,ENAA,3706,YA SIN.
ENAA3707,QA3707,ENAA,3707,"I call to witness the Qur'an, custodian of all laws, --"

ENAA3713,QA3713,ENAA,3713,"We will certainly put iron collars on their heel's which will come up to their chins, so that they will not be able to raise their heads."
ENAA3714,QA3714,ENAA,3714,"And We shall raise a barrier in front of them and a barrier behind them, and cover them over so that they will not be able to see."
ENAA3715,QA3715,ENAA,3715,"Whether you warn them or do not warn, it is all the same; they will not believe."
ENAA3716,QA3716,ENAA,3716,You can only warn him who listens to the warning and fears Ar-Rahman secretly. So give him good news of forgiveness and a generous reward.
ENAA3717,QA3717,ENAA,3717,"It is We indeed who bring back the dead to life, and write down what they send ahead (of their deeds), and traces that they leave behind. We keep an account of all things in a lucid register."
ENAA3718,QA3718,ENAA,3718,Narrate to them the example of the people of the city when the messengers came to it.
ENAA3719,QA3719,ENAA,3719,"When We sent two of them they called them liars; so We sent a third to strengthen them. ""We have been sent to you,"" they said."

ENAA3724,QA3724,ENAA,3724,"(The messengers) said: ""The augury is within your own selves. Do you (consider it a bad omen) that you should be warned? You are a people guilty of excess."""
ENAA3725,QA3725,ENAA,3725,"Then a man came running from the other side of the city. ""O my people,"" he said, ""follow the messengers."
ENAA3726,QA3726,ENAA,3726,"Follow those who do not ask for any recompense of you, and are rightly guided."
ENAA3727,QA3727,ENAA,3727,"Why should I not worship Him who brought me into being, to whom you will be brought back in the end?"
ENAA3728,QA3728,ENAA,3728,"Should I take other gods apart from Him, who would neither be able to intercede for me nor save me if Ar-Rahman brings me harm?"
ENAA3729,QA3729,ENAA,3729,In that case I would surely be in clear error.
ENAA3730,QA3730,ENAA,3730,"I believe in your Lord, so listen to me."""
ENAA3731,QA3731,ENAA,3731,"(But they stoned him to death.) It was said to him: ""Enter Paradise;"" and he said: ""If only my people knew"

ENAA3733,QA3733,ENAA,3733,"We did not send down any army against his people from heaven, nor did We have to send one."
ENAA3734,QA3734,ENAA,3734,"There was just one blast, and they were extinguished."
ENAA3735,QA3735,ENAA,3735,Alas for men! No apostle ever came to them but they made fun of him.
ENAA3736,QA3736,ENAA,3736,Have they not seen how many generations have We destroyed before them who will not return again?

ENAA3740,QA3740,ENAA,3740,So that they may eat of its fruit; yet it was not done by their hands. Then why do they not acknowledge thanks?

ENAA3744,QA3744,ENAA,3744,"We have determined the stations of the moon, so that (after its wanderings) it returns as a dried up inflorescent spike of dates."

ENAA3746,QA3746,ENAA,3746,That We bore their progeny in the laden ark is a sign for them;
ENAA3747,QA3747,ENAA,3747,And We made similar vessels for them to ride.

ENAA3863,QA3863,ENAA,3863,Noah had verily called to Us. And how gracious was He who answered (him).
ENAA3864,QA3864,ENAA,3864,"We saved him and his family from the great affliction,"
ENAA3865,QA3865,ENAA,3865,"And made his progeny survive,"
ENAA3866,QA3866,ENAA,3866,And left (his name) for posterity.
ENAA3867,QA3867,ENAA,3867,Peace on Noah among all men.
ENAA3868,QA3868,ENAA,3868,That is how We reward those who do good.
ENAA3869,QA3869,ENAA,3869,Surely he was among Our faithful creatures.
ENAA3870,QA3870,ENAA,3870,Afterwards We drowned the others.
ENAA3871,QA3871,ENAA,3871,"And Abraham indeed was of his inducement,"
ENAA3872,QA3872,ENAA,3872,"When he came to his Lord with a heart compliant,"
ENAA3873,QA3873,ENAA,3873,"When he said to his father and his people: ""What is this you worship?"
ENAA3874,QA3874,ENAA,3874,Why do you solicit false gods instead of God?
ENAA3875,QA3875,ENAA,3875,"What do you imagine the Lord of the worlds to be?"""
ENAA3876,QA3876,ENAA,3876,"Then he looked up at the stars (they worshipped),"
ENAA3877,QA3877,ENAA,3877,"And said: ""I am sick (of what you worship)!"""
ENAA3878,QA3878,ENAA,3878,But they turned their backs on him and went away.
ENAA3879,QA3879,ENAA,3879,"Then he turned towards their gods and said: ""Why do you not eat (of these offerings)?"
ENAA3880,QA3880,ENAA,3880,"What is wrong with you that you do not speak?"""
ENAA3881,QA3881,ENAA,3881,Then he started striking them down with his right hand.
ENAA3882,QA3882,ENAA,3882,So the people descended upon him.
ENAA3883,QA3883,ENAA,3883,"""Why do you worship these you carve yourselves,"" he asked,"
ENAA3884,QA3884,ENAA,3884,"""When God has created you and what you make?"""
ENAA3885,QA3885,ENAA,3885,"""Build a pyre for him and throw him into the raging fire."""
ENAA3886,QA3886,ENAA,3886,"So they contrived a plot against him, but We made them abject."
ENAA3887,QA3887,ENAA,3887,"And he said: ""I am going away to my Lord who will show me the way."
ENAA3888,QA3888,ENAA,3888,"(And he prayed:) ""O Lord, grant me a righteous son."""
ENAA3889,QA3889,ENAA,3889,So We gave him the good news of a clement son.
ENAA3890,QA3890,ENAA,3890,"When he was old enough to go about with him, he said: ""O my son, I dreamt that I was sacrificing you. Consider, what you think?"" He replied: ""Father, do as you are commanded. If God pleases you will find me firm."""
ENAA3891,QA3891,ENAA,3891,"When they submitted to the will of God, and (Abraham) laid (his son) down prostrate on his temple,"
ENAA3892,QA3892,ENAA,3892,"We called out: ""O Abraham,"
ENAA3893,QA3893,ENAA,3893,"You have fulfilled your dream."" Thus do We reward the good."
ENAA3894,QA3894,ENAA,3894,That was indeed a trying test.
ENAA3895,QA3895,ENAA,3895,"So We ransomed him for a great sacrifice,"
ENAA3896,QA3896,ENAA,3896,And left (his hallowed memory) for posterity.
ENAA3897,QA3897,ENAA,3897,Peace be on Abraham.
ENAA3898,QA3898,ENAA,3898,That is how We reward those who do good.
ENAA3899,QA3899,ENAA,3899,He is truly among Our faithful creatures.
ENAA3900,QA3900,ENAA,3900,"So We gave him the good news of Isaac, apostle, who is among the righteous."
ENAA3901,QA3901,ENAA,3901,"And We blessed him and Isaac. Among their descendants are some who do good, but some who wrong themselves."
ENAA3902,QA3902,ENAA,3902,"We were indeed gracious to Moses and Aaron,"
ENAA3903,QA3903,ENAA,3903,"And saved them and their people from great distress,"
ENAA3904,QA3904,ENAA,3904,"And helped them, so they were victorious."
ENAA3905,QA3905,ENAA,3905,"We gave them the explicit Book,"
ENAA3906,QA3906,ENAA,3906,"And showed them the straight path,"
ENAA3907,QA3907,ENAA,3907,And left (their remembrance) for posterity.
ENAA3908,QA3908,ENAA,3908,Peace be on Moses and Aaron.
ENAA3909,QA3909,ENAA,3909,That is how We reward those who do good.
ENAA3910,QA3910,ENAA,3910,They are among Our faithful devotees.
ENAA3911,QA3911,ENAA,3911,Verily Elias is one of the apostles.
ENAA3912,QA3912,ENAA,3912,"When he said to his people: ""Will you not be mindful of God?"
ENAA3913,QA3913,ENAA,3913,"Would you call on Baal and leave the best of creators,"
ENAA3914,QA3914,ENAA,3914,"God, your Lord, and the Lord of your fathers?"""
ENAA3915,QA3915,ENAA,3915,"They denied him, and will surely be brought to punishment,"
ENAA3916,QA3916,ENAA,3916,Except the chosen creatures of God.
ENAA3917,QA3917,ENAA,3917,And We left his (memory) for posterity.
ENAA3918,QA3918,ENAA,3918,Peace be on Elias.
ENAA3919,QA3919,ENAA,3919,That is how We reward those who do good.
ENAA3920,QA3920,ENAA,3920,He is truly among Our faithful devotees.
ENAA3921,QA3921,ENAA,3921,"Verily Lot was one of the apostles,"
ENAA3922,QA3922,ENAA,3922,Wherefore We saved him and his entire family
ENAA3923,QA3923,ENAA,3923,Except an old woman who was one of those who stayed behind.
ENAA3924,QA3924,ENAA,3924,Then We destroyed the others.
ENAA3925,QA3925,ENAA,3925,You pass by (their habitations) in the morning
ENAA3926,QA3926,ENAA,3926,Or at night. Then how is it you do not understand?
ENAA3927,QA3927,ENAA,3927,Verily Jonah is one of the apostles.
ENAA3928,QA3928,ENAA,3928,"When he fled on the laden ship,"
ENAA3929,QA3929,ENAA,3929,"And lots were cast (when a storm overtook them), he was rejected, (and thrown overboard)."
ENAA3930,QA3930,ENAA,3930,Then he was swallowed by a large fish as he was worthy of blame.
ENAA3931,QA3931,ENAA,3931,"Had he not been one of those who struggled hard,"
ENAA3932,QA3932,ENAA,3932,He would have stayed in its belly till the day the dead are raised.
ENAA3933,QA3933,ENAA,3933,"So We cast him, sick, on a barren shore,"
ENAA3934,QA3934,ENAA,3934,And We made a gourd tree grow over him.
ENAA3935,QA3935,ENAA,3935,"We sent him to a hundred thousand men or more,"
ENAA3936,QA3936,ENAA,3936,And they came to believe; so We allowed them to enjoy the good things of life for an age.
ENAA3937,QA3937,ENAA,3937,"Now ask them if their Lord has daughters, and they sons?"
ENAA3938,QA3938,ENAA,3938,"Or did We make the angels females, and they witnessed it?"
ENAA3939,QA3939,ENAA,3939,Is it not a lie invented by them when they say:
ENAA3940,QA3940,ENAA,3940,"""God has begotten (children)?"" They are liars indeed!"
ENAA3941,QA3941,ENAA,3941,Does He prefer sons to daughters?
ENAA3942,QA3942,ENAA,3942,What ails you that you judge in such a wise?
ENAA3943,QA3943,ENAA,3943,Why do you not reflect?
ENAA3944,QA3944,ENAA,3944,Or have you received some clear authority?
ENAA3945,QA3945,ENAA,3945,"Then bring your scripture, if what you say is true."
ENAA3946,QA3946,ENAA,3946,"They link Him with jinns by lineage, yet the jinns know they will be brought before Him."
ENAA3947,QA3947,ENAA,3947,God is too glorious for what they ascribe to Him
ENAA3948,QA3948,ENAA,3948,Except His chosen creatures who do not.
ENAA3949,QA3949,ENAA,3949,So neither you nor those you worship
ENAA3950,QA3950,ENAA,3950,"Can mislead anyone away from Him,"
ENAA3951,QA3951,ENAA,3951,Except one who is (destined) to burn in Hell.
ENAA3952,QA3952,ENAA,3952,"""There is not one of us who does not have his appointed place,"" (declare the angels.)"
ENAA3953,QA3953,ENAA,3953,"""And we are truly those who stand in rows,"
ENAA3954,QA3954,ENAA,3954,"And we are those who sing hallelujas to Him."""
ENAA3955,QA3955,ENAA,3955,They used to say:
ENAA3956,QA3956,ENAA,3956,"If we had the account of earlier people with us,"
ENAA3957,QA3957,ENAA,3957,"We would have been the chosen creatures of God."""
ENAA3958,QA3958,ENAA,3958,Yet now (that it has come) they refuse to believe in it; but they will come to know soon.
ENAA3959,QA3959,ENAA,3959,"Our word had already been given before to Our votaries, the apostles, --"
ENAA3960,QA3960,ENAA,3960,"That they would be helped,"
ENAA3961,QA3961,ENAA,3961,And that certainly Our armies will be victorious.
ENAA3962,QA3962,ENAA,3962,So you ignore them for a time
ENAA3963,QA3963,ENAA,3963,And wait; they will come to know soon.
ENAA3964,QA3964,ENAA,3964,Do they want to hasten Our punishment?
ENAA3965,QA3965,ENAA,3965,"When it comes down on their plains, it will be an evil dawn for those who had been warned."
ENAA3966,QA3966,ENAA,3966,So turn away from them for a time
ENAA3967,QA3967,ENAA,3967,And watch; they will come to know soon.
ENAA3968,QA3968,ENAA,3968,"Too glorious is your Lord, the Lord of power, for what they ascribe to Him."
ENAA3969,QA3969,ENAA,3969,"So peace be on the messengers,"
ENAA3970,QA3970,ENAA,3970,"And all praise to God, the Lord of all the worlds."
ENAA3971,QA3971,ENAA,3971,SAD. I CALL to witness the admonishing Qur'an.
ENAA3972,QA3972,ENAA,3972,But the unbelievers are still full of pride and hostility.
ENAA3973,QA3973,ENAA,3973,How many generations have We destroyed before them who cried (for mercy) when it was too late for escape.
ENAA3974,QA3974,ENAA,3974,"They were surprised that one of them had come to them as warner; and the unbelievers said: ""He is a deceiving sorcerer."
ENAA3975,QA3975,ENAA,3975,"Has he turned so many gods into one deity? This is indeed a strange thing!"""
ENAA3976,QA3976,ENAA,3976,"And their leading chiefs said: ""Remain attached to your gods. There is surely some motive behind it."
ENAA3977,QA3977,ENAA,3977,We never heard of it in the former faith. It is surely a fabrication.
ENAA3978,QA3978,ENAA,3978,"To him of all of us has the Reminder been sent down?"" They are still in doubt about My admonition; but they have not tasted My punishment yet!"
ENAA3979,QA3979,ENAA,3979,"Do they have the stores of the mercy of your Lord, the mighty and munificent?"
ENAA3980,QA3980,ENAA,3980,"Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, theirs? Then let them climb up the ladders (to the heavens)."
ENAA3981,QA3981,ENAA,3981,They will be one more army vanquished among the many routed hordes.
ENAA3982,QA3982,ENAA,3982,"Even before them the people of Noah, 'Ad, the mighty Pharoah,"
ENAA3983,QA3983,ENAA,3983,"And the Thamud, the people of Lot, as well as the dwellers of the Wood, had denied. These were the hordes."
ENAA3984,QA3984,ENAA,3984,Of all these there was not one who did not deny the messengers. So My retribution was justified.
ENAA3985,QA3985,ENAA,3985,They await but a single blast which will not be repeated.
ENAA3986,QA3986,ENAA,3986,"Still they say: ""O Lord, give us our share before the Day of Reckoning."""
ENAA3987,QA3987,ENAA,3987,"Bear with patience what they say, and remember Our votary David, man of strength. He surely turned to Us in penitence."
ENAA3988,QA3988,ENAA,3988,"We subjugated the chiefs (of tribes) to struggle day and night with him,"
ENAA3989,QA3989,ENAA,3989,And the levied Tair. They were all obedient to him.
ENAA3990,QA3990,ENAA,3990,"So We further strengthened his kingdom, and bestowed wisdom on him, and judgement in legal matters."
ENAA3991,QA3991,ENAA,3991,Have you heard of the litigants who jumped over the wall into his chamber?
ENAA3992,QA3992,ENAA,3992,"When they came before David, he was frightened of them. ""Do not be afraid,"" they said. ""The two of us are disputing the wrong one has done the other. So judge between us with equity, and do not be unjust, and guide us to the right path."
ENAA3993,QA3993,ENAA,3993,"This man here is my brother. He has ninety and nine ewes while I have only one. He demands that I should give him my ewe, and wants to get the better of me in argument."""
ENAA3994,QA3994,ENAA,3994,"(David) said: ""He is unjust in demanding your ewe to add to his (many) ewes. Many partners are surely -- unjust to one another, except those who believe and do the right; but there are only a few of them."" It occurred to David that he was being tried by Us, and he begged his Lord to forgive him, and fell down in homage and repented."
ENAA3995,QA3995,ENAA,3995,So We forgave him. He has surely a high rank with Us and an excellent place of return.
ENAA3996,QA3996,ENAA,3996,"""O David, We have made you trustee on the earth. So judge between men equitably, and do not follow your lust lest it should lead you astray from the way of God. Surely for those who go astray from the way of God, is severe punishment, for having forgotten the Day of Reckoning."
ENAA3997,QA3997,ENAA,3997,"We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, all for nothing. Only those who deny imagine so. So for the unbelievers there is woe from the fire."
ENAA3998,QA3998,ENAA,3998,Should We equate those who do the right with those who spread corruption in the land? Should We make those who are morally integrated equal to those who seek disintegration?
ENAA3999,QA3999,ENAA,3999,"We have sent down a Book to you which is blessed, so that people may apply their minds to its revelations, and the men of wisdom may reflect."
ENAA4000,QA4000,ENAA,4000,"We bestowed Solomon on David who was an excellent devotee, for he turned to God in penitence."
ENAA4001,QA4001,ENAA,4001,"When they brought fleet-footed chargers in the evening to show him,"
ENAA4002,QA4002,ENAA,4002,"He said: ""The love of horses is worthy of desire to me for the remembrance of my Lord;"" and when they were out of sight, (he said):"
ENAA4003,QA4003,ENAA,4003,"""Bring them back to me,"" and he began to rub and stroke their shanks and necks."
ENAA4004,QA4004,ENAA,4004,"We surely tried Solomon, and placed another body on his throne. So he turned to God"
ENAA4005,QA4005,ENAA,4005,"Saying: ""O Lord, forgive me, and give me such a dominion as none will merit after me. You are the great bestower."""
ENAA4006,QA4006,ENAA,4006,So we subjugated the wind to his service which carried his merchandise wheresoever he wished;
ENAA4007,QA4007,ENAA,4007,"And the devils -- the builders and divers of all kinds,"
ENAA4008,QA4008,ENAA,4008,And many others bound in bond.
ENAA4009,QA4009,ENAA,4009,"""This is Our gift,"" (We said to him), ""so bestow freely or withhold without reckoning."""
ENAA4010,QA4010,ENAA,4010,He has a high position with Us and an excellent abode.
ENAA4011,QA4011,ENAA,4011,"Remember Our votary Job because he called to his Lord: ""Satan has afflicted me with disease and distress."""
ENAA4012,QA4012,ENAA,4012,"""Go swiftly to the spring,"" (We said). ""This cold water is for bathing and for drinking."""
ENAA4013,QA4013,ENAA,4013,"We restored his family to him with others similar to them, as a blessing from Us and a reminder for men of wisdom. --"
ENAA4014,QA4014,ENAA,4014,"""Take a handful of herbs,"" (We said to him), and apply and rub them, and do not make a mistake."" We found him patient in adversity, an excellent devotee, always turning in repentance."
ENAA4015,QA4015,ENAA,4015,"Remember Our votaries Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, men of power and insight."
ENAA4016,QA4016,ENAA,4016,We distinguished them for the distinct remembrance of the abode (of the Hereafter).
ENAA4017,QA4017,ENAA,4017,"They are the chosen ones, the excellent in Our sight."
ENAA4018,QA4018,ENAA,4018,"And remember Ishmael, Elisha and Dhu'l-Kifl. Every one of them is among the best."
ENAA4019,QA4019,ENAA,4019,This is a commemoration. Surely for those who take heed for themselves is an excellent place of return --
ENAA4020,QA4020,ENAA,4020,"Gardens of Eden with gates open wide to them,"
ENAA4021,QA4021,ENAA,4021,"Where they will take their ease, calling for fruits in plenty, and for wine,"
ENAA4022,QA4022,ENAA,4022,"With companions of modest look, the same in age, by their side."
ENAA4023,QA4023,ENAA,4023,This is what is promised you for the Day of Reckoning.
ENAA4024,QA4024,ENAA,4024,This is surely Our provision never-ending.
ENAA4025,QA4025,ENAA,4025,"This (for the virtuous); but for the transgressors the evil destination,"
ENAA4026,QA4026,ENAA,4026,"Hell, in which they will burn. How vile a resting place!"
ENAA4027,QA4027,ENAA,4027,"There will be boiling water for them and cold, clammy, fetid drink to taste,"
ENAA4028,QA4028,ENAA,4028,And other similar torments.
ENAA4029,QA4029,ENAA,4029,Here is a multitude rushing headlong with you. There is no welcome for them. They will roast in the fire.
ENAA4030,QA4030,ENAA,4030,"They will say: ""In fact, it is you who will have no welcome. It is you who brought this upon us. What an evil place of rest!"""
ENAA4031,QA4031,ENAA,4031,"They will say: ""O Lord, give him who has brought this upon us two times more the torment of Hell;"""

ENAA4033,QA4033,ENAA,4033,"Did we laugh at them (for nothing), or our eyes fail to pick them out?"""
ENAA4034,QA4034,ENAA,4034,This contending of the inmates of Hell will surely be real.
ENAA4035,QA4035,ENAA,4035,"Say: ""I am only a warner, and there is no other god but God, the one, the omnipotent,"

ENAA4037,QA4037,ENAA,4037,"Say: ""This is a momentous message,"

ENAA4513,QA4513,ENAA,4513,We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them but with a purpose for an appointed time. Yet the unbelievers turn away from the warning.
ENAA4514,QA4514,ENAA,4514,"Say: ""Have you thought of those you invoke apart from God? Show me what they have created of the earth, or, do they have a share in the heavens? Bring me an earlier Book than this, or inherited knowledge, if you are truthful."""
ENAA4515,QA4515,ENAA,4515,"Who is more astray than he who calls on those, apart from God, who cannot answer their prayers till the Day of Resurrection, and are even unaware of being called."
ENAA4516,QA4516,ENAA,4516,When all men are gathered together (on that Day) they will become their enemies and deny their worship.
ENAA4517,QA4517,ENAA,4517,"When Our clear revelations are read out to them, the infidels say of the truth, when it has come to them: ""This is pure magic."""
ENAA4518,QA4518,ENAA,4518,"Do they say: ""He has fabricated it?"" Tell them: ""If I have fabricated it, you have no power to save me from God. He knows what you are busy with concerning this. He is sufficient as witness between you and me; yet He is forgiving, ever-merciful."""
ENAA4519,QA4519,ENAA,4519,"Say: ""I am not a new Messenger to come, nor do I know what is to be done to me or you. I only follow what is revealed to me. My duty is only to warn you clearly."""
ENAA4520,QA4520,ENAA,4520,"Tell them: ""Think (of the consequence) if this is from God and you deny it when a witness from the people of Israel had testified to the like of it and come to believe, while you spurn it?"" Assuredly God does not guide a wicked people."
ENAA4521,QA4521,ENAA,4521,"Those who deny say of those who believe: ""Had there been any good in it they would not have preceded us in coming to it."" Since they have not taken guidance from it, they will say: ""This is the same old lie."""
ENAA4522,QA4522,ENAA,4522,"There was the Book of Moses before this, a guide and a mercy; and here is this Book confirming it in lucid language, warning those who are wicked, and giving happy tidings to the righteous."
ENAA4523,QA4523,ENAA,4523,"Surely for those who say, ""God is our Lord,"" and then remain firm, there is no fear or regret."
ENAA4524,QA4524,ENAA,4524,They are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever as a recompense for what they had done.
ENAA4525,QA4525,ENAA,4525,"We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents: His mother carries him in her womb with hardship, and gives birth to him in pain. Thirty months is the period of her carrying and weaning him. When he attains to manhood and the age of forty, he says: ""O Lord, guide me to thank You for the favours You have bestowed on me and my parents, and to do things good as may please You, and give me a righteous off-spring. I turn to You in penitence and submit."""
ENAA4526,QA4526,ENAA,4526,"They are those from whom We accept the very best of what they have done, and overlook their faults. They will be among the inmates of Paradise: A true promise they have been made."

ENAA4545,QA4545,ENAA,4545,"So bear with patience, as the apostles who were constant, bore; and do not be hasty (in demanding punishment) for them.

Then either free them graciously or after taking a ransom, until war shall have come to end.

ENAA4555,QA4555,ENAA,4555,Have they not journeyed in the land and seen the fate of those before them? Destroyed they were utterly by God; and a similar (fate) awaits the unbelievers.
ENAA4556,QA4556,ENAA,4556,This is so for God is the friend of those who believe while the unbelievers have no friend.
ENAA4557,QA4557,ENAA,4557,"Verily God will admit those who believe and do the right into gardens with streams of water running by. But the unbelievers revel and carouse and subsist like beasts, and Hell will be their residence."
ENAA4558,QA4558,ENAA,4558,"How many were the habitations, mightier than your city which has turned you out, which We destroyed; and they did not have a helper."

ENAA4560,QA4560,ENAA,4560,"The semblance of Paradise promised the pious and devout (is that of a garden) with streams of water that will not go rank, and rivers of milk whose taste will not undergo a change, and rivers of wine delectable to drinkers, and streams of purified honey, and fruits of every kind in them, and forgiveness of their Lord. Are these like those who will live for ever in the Fire and be given boiling water to drink which will cut their intestines to shreds?"
ENAA4561,QA4561,ENAA,4561,"There are some who listen to you; but as soon as they go from you they say to those who were given knowledge: ""What is this he is saying now?"" They are those whose hearts have been sealed by God, and they follow their own lusts."

ENAA4563,QA4563,ENAA,4563,"Do they wait for any thing but the Hour (of change), that it may come upon them suddenly? Its signs have already appeared. How then will they be warned when it has come upon them?"
ENAA4564,QA4564,ENAA,4564,"Know then, therefore, there is no god but He, and ask forgiveness for your sins and those of believing men and women. God knows your wanderings and your destination."
ENAA4565,QA4565,ENAA,4565,"Those who believe say: ""How is it no Surah was revealed?"" But when a categorical Surah is revealed that mentions war, you should see those who are sceptical staring at you like a man in the swoon of death. Alas the woe for them!"
ENAA4566,QA4566,ENAA,4566,Obedience and modest speech (would have been more becoming). And when the matter has been determined it is best for them to be true to God.

ENAA4579,QA4579,ENAA,4579,"Those who do not believe and obstruct others from the way of God, and die disbelieving, will not be pardoned by God."

ENAA4612,QA4612,ENAA,4612,"Muhammad is the Prophet of God; and those who are with him are severe with infidels but compassionate among themselves. You may see them kneeling and bowing in reverence, seeking His favour and acceptance. Their mark is on their foreheads from the effect of prostrations. Their likeness in the Torah, and their likeness in the Gospel, is like a seed that sends out a stalk, then makes it firm, and it becomes strong and rises straight upon its stem, gladdening the cultivator's heart, in order to fill the unbelievers with dismay.

ENAA5055,QA5055,ENAA,5055,And this surely is great evidence if you can understand --
ENAA5056,QA5056,ENAA,5056,That this is indeed the glorious Qur'an
ENAA5057,QA5057,ENAA,5057,(Inscribed) in the well-kept Book.
ENAA5058,QA5058,ENAA,5058,Only they can reach it who are clean (of mind).
ENAA5059,QA5059,ENAA,5059,It has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds.
ENAA5060,QA5060,ENAA,5060,Then why do you dissimulate this Revelation?
ENAA5061,QA5061,ENAA,5061,You live by calling it a lie.
ENAA5062,QA5062,ENAA,5062,"Then how is it that when the (dying) breath is withdrawn into the throat (and rattles),"
ENAA5063,QA5063,ENAA,5063,"And you wait for the moment (of death),"
ENAA5064,QA5064,ENAA,5064,"We are closer to him than you, even though you cannot see?"
ENAA5065,QA5065,ENAA,5065,"Then why, if you are not indebted (to Us for life),"
ENAA5066,QA5066,ENAA,5066,Can you not bring him back? (Answer) if you are truthful
ENAA5067,QA5067,ENAA,5067,"Then, if he is one of the honoured,"
ENAA5068,QA5068,ENAA,5068,"There will be peace and plenty, and gardens of tranquility for him."
ENAA5069,QA5069,ENAA,5069,"If he is of those of the right hand,"
ENAA5070,QA5070,ENAA,5070,"There will be the salutation by those of the right hand: ""Peace on you."
ENAA5071,QA5071,ENAA,5071,"But if he is of the deniers and the errants,"
ENAA5072,QA5072,ENAA,5072,The welcome will be boiling water
ENAA5073,QA5073,ENAA,5073,And the roasting in Hell.
ENAA5074,QA5074,ENAA,5074,This is indeed the ultimate truth.
ENAA5075,QA5075,ENAA,5075,"Then praise your Lord, the most supreme."
ENAA5076,QA5076,ENAA,5076,WHATSOEVER IS IN the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. He is all-mighty and all-wise.
ENAA5077,QA5077,ENAA,5077,"His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, He is the giver of life and death, and He has power over everything."
ENAA5078,QA5078,ENAA,5078,"He is the first and He the last, the transcendent and the immanent; and He has knowledge of everything."
ENAA5079,QA5079,ENAA,5079,"It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six stages, then assumed the throne. He knows whatsoever enters the earth, and whatsoever comes out of it, and what comes down from the sky and what goes up to it; and He is with you wheresoever you may be, and He perceives whatsoever you do."
ENAA5080,QA5080,ENAA,5080,"His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all things will go back to Him."
ENAA5081,QA5081,ENAA,5081,"He turns night into day, and turns day into night; and He knows whatsoever is in your hearts."
ENAA5082,QA5082,ENAA,5082,"Believe in God and His Apostle, and spend of what He has given you as His trustee. And those of you who believe and spend in charity will have a great reward."
ENAA5083,QA5083,ENAA,5083,"What has come upon you that you believe not in God, though the Prophet is calling you to believe in your Lord? And He has already taken your pledge, if you are believers."
ENAA5084,QA5084,ENAA,5084,It is He who sends down splendent revelations to His votary that he may take you out of darkness into light; for surely God is gracious and kind to you.
ENAA5085,QA5085,ENAA,5085,"What has come upon you that you do not spend in the way of God, when the heritage of the heavens and the earth belongs to God? Those of you who spent before the victory and fought, are not equal (to those who did not). They are higher in position than those who spent after (the victory) and fought. To each one God has made the promise of excellence, for God is aware of all you do."
ENAA5086,QA5086,ENAA,5086,"Who will give a goodly loan to God which He will double for him, and be for him a splendid reward?"
ENAA5087,QA5087,ENAA,5087,"The day you see the believers, men and women, with their light advancing ahead and to the right of them, (they will be told:) ""There is good news for you this day, of gardens with rivers flowing by where you will live for ever."" This will be the great attainment."
ENAA5088,QA5088,ENAA,5088,"The day the hypocrites, men and women, will say to the believers: ""Wait for us that we may borrow a little light from your light,"" they will be told: ""Go back, and look for your light."" A wall shall be raised between them in which there will be a door. Within it will be benevolence and retribution without."
ENAA5089,QA5089,ENAA,5089,"They will call to them: ""Were we not with you?"" They will answer: ""Certainly; but then you let yourselves be tempted, and waited in expectation but were suspicious and were deceived by vain desires, till the decree of God came to pass, and the deceiver duped you in respect of God."
ENAA5090,QA5090,ENAA,5090,"So no ransom will be accepted of you on this day, or of those who refused to believe. Hell will be your refuge and the only friend -- and how evil a destination!"""
ENAA5091,QA5091,ENAA,5091,"Has the moment not yet come when the hearts of believers should be moved by the thought of God and the truth that has been sent down, so that they should not be like those who received the Book before them but whose hearts were hardened after a lapse of time, and many of them turned disobedient?"
ENAA5092,QA5092,ENAA,5092,Know that God enlivens the earth even after it has died. We have explained to you clearly Our signs that you may understand.
ENAA5093,QA5093,ENAA,5093,"Surely the men and women who spend in charity and give a goodly loan to God, will have it doubled for them and will receive a generous reward."
ENAA5094,QA5094,ENAA,5094,"Those who believe in God and His apostles are true of word and deed; and by their Lord are considered testifiers of the truth. They have their guerdon and their light. As for those who do not believe and reject Our revelations, are the people of Hell."
ENAA5095,QA5095,ENAA,5095,"Know that the life of this world is only a frolic and mummery, an ornamentation, boasting and bragging among yourselves, and lust for multiplying wealth and children. It is like rain so pleasing to the cultivator for his vegetation which sprouts and swells, and then begins to wither, and you see it turn to yellow and reduced to chaff. There is severe punishment in the Hereafter, but also forgiveness from God, and acceptance. As for the life of this world, it is no more than merchandise of vanity."
ENAA5096,QA5096,ENAA,5096,"Hasten for the forgiveness of your Lord and Paradise whose expanse is as wide as that of the heavens and the earth, which has been prepared for those who believe in God and His apostles. This is the bounty of God which He bestows on whosoever He please; and the bounty of God is infinite."
ENAA5097,QA5097,ENAA,5097,There is no calamity that befalls the earth or your own selves but in accordance with the law (of causation) before We make it evident. This is indeed how the law of God works inevitably.
ENAA5098,QA5098,ENAA,5098,"Lest you grieve for what you missed, or rejoice at what you received. God does not love the egoist and the braggart,"
ENAA5099,QA5099,ENAA,5099,"Who hold back what they possess and enjoin stinginess on others. Whoever turns away (from God, should remember) that God is self-sufficient, worthy of praise."
ENAA5100,QA5100,ENAA,5100,"We have surely sent apostles with clear signs, and sent with them the Book and the Balance, so that men may stand by justice; and We sent down iron which causes much distress but also has advantages for men, so that God may know who helps Him and His apostles in secret. Verily God is all-powerful and all-mighty."
ENAA5101,QA5101,ENAA,5101,"We sent Noah and Abraham, and gave prophethood to their progeny and the Book, and some of them are well-directed, but many of them are disobedient."
ENAA5102,QA5102,ENAA,5102,"Then in their train We sent Our apostles, and succeeding them Jesus, son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel, and put into the hearts of his followers compassion and kindness. But they created monasticism which had not been prescribed for them by Us except for seeking the pleasure of God; yet they did not observe it as it should have been rightly observed. So We gave those among them who were believers their reward; but most of them are disobedient."
ENAA5103,QA5103,ENAA,5103,"O you who believe, have fear of displeasing God, and believe in His Prophet. He will give you twice as much of His bounty and place a light for you to walk in, and forgive you, for God is forgiving and kind;"
ENAA5104,QA5104,ENAA,5104,"So that the people of the Book may know that they have not the least power over the bounty of God, and that the bounty is wholly in the hands of God to give whosoever He please, for God is the master of infinite bounty."
ENAA5105,QA5105,ENAA,5105,"GOD CERTAINLY HEARD what the woman who argued with you about her husband, said, and complained to God; and God heard your interrogation. Verily God hears all, and sees everything."
ENAA5106,QA5106,ENAA,5106,"Those of you who divorce your wives by calling them 'mothers,' cannot (make them) their mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. They surely utter what is unseemly and a lie. But God is forbearing and forgiving."
ENAA5107,QA5107,ENAA,5107,"Those who call their wives their mothers then revoke what they had said, should free a slave before having physical contact (with them). This is to warn you, as God is aware of what you do."
ENAA5108,QA5108,ENAA,5108,"If one does not have the means (of doing so) then he should fast for two months continuously before he has physical contact; but any one who is unable to do so, should feed sixty needy persons. This (is enjoined) so that you may be faithful to God and His Apostle. These are the limits set by God. As for the unbelievers, there is painful punishment for them."
ENAA5109,QA5109,ENAA,5109,"Those who oppose God will be disgraced, as those before them were. We have sent down very clear signs. For unbelievers there is a shameful punishment."
ENAA5110,QA5110,ENAA,5110,"On the day when God will raise them up together, He will tell them what they did. God takes account of it although they forget, for all things are evident to God."
ENAA5111,QA5111,ENAA,5111,"Have you not considered that God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth? No three persons confer secretly but He is the fourth among them, and no five but He is the sixth; and neither fewer nor more but He is with them wheresoever they be. And on the Day of Judgement He will announce their deeds to them. Verily God has knowledge of everything."
ENAA5112,QA5112,ENAA,5112,"Have you not considered those who were forbidden to conspire, but reverted after a time to what was forbidden them, and conspired evil, rebellion and disobedience to the Prophet? Yet when they come to you they greet you with a greeting even God does not greet you with; and say to themselves, ""Why doesn't God punish us for what we say?"" Hell is sufficient for them, in which they will be burnt: And what an evil consequence!"
ENAA5113,QA5113,ENAA,5113,"O you who believe, when you converse privately, do not talk of iniquity, rebellion, and disobedience to the Prophet, but talk of goodness and piety, and fear God before whom you will be gathered."
ENAA5114,QA5114,ENAA,5114,Surely scheming is the work of Satan that he may cause the faithful grief; but he cannot harm them unless God dispense. So in God should the believers place their trust.
ENAA5115,QA5115,ENAA,5115,"O you who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room; God will give you more room to spread. When you are told to rise, then rise; God will raise those of you who believe, and those who have knowledge, in position. God is aware of what you do."
ENAA5116,QA5116,ENAA,5116,"O you who believe, if you confer with the Prophet in private, give alms in the name of God before you go to confer. This is better for you and becoming. If you do not have the means, then surely God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA5117,QA5117,ENAA,5117,"Are you afraid of giving alms before confering? Then, if you cannot do this, and God forgives you, be constant in your devotional obligations and pay the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others, and obey God and His Prophet. God is aware of all you do."
ENAA5118,QA5118,ENAA,5118,"Have you not seen those who have taken a people who have roused the wrath of God, as friends? They are neither of you nor of them, and swear to a lie, and knowingly."
ENAA5119,QA5119,ENAA,5119,God has reserved a severe punishment for them. Evil indeed are the things they do!
ENAA5120,QA5120,ENAA,5120,"They have made their oaths a shield, and obstruct people from the way of God. There is shameful punishment for them."
ENAA5121,QA5121,ENAA,5121,"Neither their wealth nor children will avail them against God. They are the people of Hell, and there will abide for ever."
ENAA5122,QA5122,ENAA,5122,"On the day that God will raise them together, they will swear before Him as they swear before you, and imagine they are on the right path. Is it not they who are liars?"
ENAA5123,QA5123,ENAA,5123,Satan has got the better of them. and made them forget to remember God. Indeed they belong to Satan's faction. Will not Satan's faction perish?
ENAA5124,QA5124,ENAA,5124,Surely those who oppose God and His Prophet will be among the vilest.
ENAA5125,QA5125,ENAA,5125,"God has decreed: ""I will prevail, I and My apostles."" Verily God is powerful and all-mighty."
ENAA5126,QA5126,ENAA,5126,"You will not find those who believe in God and the Day of Resurrection, loving those who oppose God and His Prophet, even though they be their fathers, sons, or brothers or their kin. God has inscribed on their hearts belief, and has succoured them with His own grace, and will admit them to gardens with rivers flowing by, where they will abide for ever, God accepting them, and they, happy in the pleasure of God. They are verily the army of God. Will not the army of God be victorious?"
ENAA5127,QA5127,ENAA,5127,WHATEVER IS IN the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. He is all-mighty and all-wise.
ENAA5128,QA5128,ENAA,5128,"It is He who drove those among the people of the Book who refused to believe, from their homes for the first confrontation. You did not think that they would go away, and they imagined that their forts would protect them against God. But God came upon them from where they did not suspect, and filled their hearts with terror, so that they destroyed their homes with their own hands (or were destroyed) by the hands of believers. So take heed, O men of sight!"
ENAA5129,QA5129,ENAA,5129,"Had God not decreed the expulsion for them He would have punished them in this world, and in the next the punishment of Hell would have been theirs."
ENAA5130,QA5130,ENAA,5130,"For they had opposed God and His Apostle; and whosoever opposes God, then God is severe in retribution."
ENAA5131,QA5131,ENAA,5131,"The palm trees that you cut down or left standing intact was by God's dispensation, so that He might disgrace the transgressors."
ENAA5132,QA5132,ENAA,5132,"You did not charge with horse or camel for whatever (spoils) God gave His Apostle from them. In any case, God gives authority to His Apostle over whomsoever He please. God has power over everything."
ENAA5133,QA5133,ENAA,5133,"Whatever booty God gives to His Apostle from the people of the cities, is for God and His Apostle, the near relations, the orphans, the needy and wayfarers, so that it does not concentrate in the hands of those who are rich among you. Accept what the Apostle gives you, and refrain from what he forbids, and take heed for yourself and fear God. Surely God is severe of retribution."
ENAA5134,QA5134,ENAA,5134,"The spoils are also for the poor emigrants who were deprived of their homes and possessions and are seeking the bounty and protection of God, and are helping God and His Apostle. They are the ones who are true of word and deed."
ENAA5135,QA5135,ENAA,5135,"Those who came to the city and to faith before them, love those who take refuge with them, and do not feel for themselves any need for what is given them, and give them preference over themselves even if they are indigent. Whoever preserves himself from his own greed will be prosperous."
ENAA5136,QA5136,ENAA,5136,"(And the spoils are for) those who came after them, who say: ""O Lord, forgive us and our brothers who came to faith before us, and do not put a grudge in our hearts against those who believe O Lord, You are compassionate and kind."""
ENAA5137,QA5137,ENAA,5137,"Have you never considered the hypocrites? They say to their brethren among the people of the Book who do not believe: ""If you are driven out we shall go with you, and will not listen to any one in what concerns you; and if there is war against you, we shall aid you."" But God is witness they are liars."
ENAA5138,QA5138,ENAA,5138,"If they are driven out, they will not go with them; and if they are attacked, they will not aid them. And even if they aided them, they will turn their backs, then they will not be helped."
ENAA5139,QA5139,ENAA,5139,"Surely they have greater fear of you in their hearts than of God, because they do not understand."
ENAA5140,QA5140,ENAA,5140,"They will not fight you in a body except in fortified cities, or from behind the walls. Their enmity among themselves is great. You think they are united, but divided are their hearts. That is because these people are devoid of sense,"
ENAA5141,QA5141,ENAA,5141,Like those who had tasted the gravity of their actions a little before them. There is a grievous punishment for them.
ENAA5142,QA5142,ENAA,5142,"(They are) like Satan who says to man: ""Do not believe;"" and when he becomes a disbeliever, he says: ""I have nothing to do with you. I fear God, the Lord of all the worlds."""
ENAA5143,QA5143,ENAA,5143,"Both of them will end up in Hell, where they will abide for ever. This is the punishment for the wicked."
ENAA5144,QA5144,ENAA,5144,"O you who believe, be fearful of God. Let each soul consider what it has sent (of good deeds) in advance for the morrow, and fear God. Surely God is aware of what you do."
ENAA5145,QA5145,ENAA,5145,"And be not like those who have forgotten God, so that God has made them forget themselves. Such are the reprobates."
ENAA5146,QA5146,ENAA,5146,Alike are not the inmates of Hell and the residents of Paradise. The men of Paradise will be felicitous.
ENAA5147,QA5147,ENAA,5147,If We had sent down this Qur'an to a mountain you would have seen it turn desolate and split into two for fear of God. We offer these examples to men that they may think and reflect.
ENAA5148,QA5148,ENAA,5148,"He is God; there is no god but He, the knower of the unknown and the known. He is the benevolent, ever-merciful."
ENAA5149,QA5149,ENAA,5149,"He is God; there is no god but He, the King, the Holy, the Preserver, Protector, Guardian, the Strong, the Powerful, Omnipotent. Far too exalted is God for what they associate with Him."
ENAA5150,QA5150,ENAA,5150,"He is God, the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner. His are all the names beautiful. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth sings His praises. He is all-mighty and all-wise."
ENAA5151,QA5151,ENAA,5151,"O YOU WHO BELIEVE, do not take My enemies and your enemies as friends. You show kindness to them, but they reject the true way that has come to you. They expelled the Prophet and you, for you believe in God your Lord. If you have come out to struggle in My cause having sought My acceptance, (do not be) friendly with them in secret. I know what you hide and what you disclose. Whoever of you does this will have gone astray from the right path."
ENAA5152,QA5152,ENAA,5152,"If they gain ascendancy over you, they will become your enemies, and employ their hands and tongues with evil designs, and wish that you also became disbelievers."
ENAA5153,QA5153,ENAA,5153,"Neither your blood relations nor your children will be of any avail to you on the Day of Resurrection. He will judge between you, for God sees what you do."
ENAA5154,QA5154,ENAA,5154,"You have an excellent model in Abraham and those who were with him, when he said to his people: ""We are through with you, and those you worship other than God. We reject you. Enmity and hate have come between you and us for ever, unless you believe in God the One,"" -- except for what he said to his father: ""I shall ask forgiveness for you, but I have no power to prevail with God for you."" ""O Lord, we place our trust in You, and turn to You in penitence, and to You is our returning."
ENAA5155,QA5155,ENAA,5155,"O Lord, make us not an example of punishment for infidels, and forgive us, O Lord. You are all-mighty and all-wise."""
ENAA5156,QA5156,ENAA,5156,"Those of you who have hope in God and the Last Day have certainly a good example in them. But whosoever turns away, then surely God is above concern, worthy of praise."
ENAA5157,QA5157,ENAA,5157,"It maybe that God will create love between you and your enemies. God is all-powerful, and God is forgiving, ever-merciful."
ENAA5158,QA5158,ENAA,5158,"God does not forbid you from being kind and acting justly towards those who did not fight over faith with you, nor expelled you from your homes. God indeed loves those who are just."
ENAA5159,QA5159,ENAA,5159,"He only forbids you from making friends with those who fought over faith with you and banished you from your homes, and aided in your exile. Whoever makes friends with them is a transgressor."
ENAA5160,QA5160,ENAA,5160,"O believers, when believing women come over to you as refugees, then examine them. God alone is cognisant of their faith. If you find that they are believers, do not send them back to unbelievers. They are not lawful for them, nor are infidels lawful for believing women. Give the unbelievers what they have spent on them. There is no sin if you marry them provided you give their dowers to them. Do not retain your (marriage) ties with unbelieving women. Ask for the return of what you have spent (on them); and the unbelievers should ask for the return of what they have spent. This is the judgement of God. He judges between you. God is all-knowing and all-wise."
ENAA5161,QA5161,ENAA,5161,"If any of your women go away to the unbelievers, and you succeed in your turn (and have a chance of getting spoils), then give to those whose wives have so gone away as much as they had spent on them; but take heed and fear God in whom you believe."
ENAA5162,QA5162,ENAA,5162,"O Prophet, when believing women come to you and swear on oath that they will not associate anything with God, nor steal, nor fornicate, nor kill their children, nor accuse others for what they have fabricated themselves, nor disobey you in any rightful thing, then you should accept their allegiance, and ask forgiveness of God for them. Certainly God is forgiving and kind."
ENAA5163,QA5163,ENAA,5163,"O you who believe, do not make friends with those who have suffered the anger of God by having become despondent of the life to come like those unbelievers who are despondent of those who are in the graves."
ENAA5164,QA5164,ENAA,5164,ALL THAT IS in the heavens and the earth sings the praises of God. He is all-mighty and all-wise.
ENAA5165,QA5165,ENAA,5165,"O you who believe, why do you profess what you do not practise?"
ENAA5166,QA5166,ENAA,5166,Saying what you do not practice is odious to God.
ENAA5167,QA5167,ENAA,5167,Surely God loves those who fight in His cause in full formations as though they were a compact wall.
ENAA5168,QA5168,ENAA,5168,"When Moses said to his people: ""O my people, why do you afflict me though you know that I have been sent to you by God?"" But when they turned aside God made their hearts turn farther away; for God does not show the transgressors the way."
ENAA5169,QA5169,ENAA,5169,"And when Jesus, son of Mary, said: ""O children of Israel, I am sent to you by God to confirm the Torah (sent) before me, and to give you good tidings of an apostle who will come after me, whose name is Ahmad (the praised one)."" Yet when he has come to them with clear proofs, they say: ""This is only magic."""
ENAA5170,QA5170,ENAA,5170,Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against God when he is called to submit? God does not show the evil-doers the way.
ENAA5171,QA5171,ENAA,5171,"They want to extinguish the light of God by uttering blasphemies. But God wills to perfect His light, however the unbelievers may dislike it."
ENAA5172,QA5172,ENAA,5172,"It is He who sent His Apostle with the guidance and the true way to raise it above all faiths, however the idolaters may dislike it."
ENAA5173,QA5173,ENAA,5173,"O you who believe, may I offer you a bargain which will save you from a painful punishment?"
ENAA5174,QA5174,ENAA,5174,"Come to believe in God and His Apostle, and struggle in the cause of God, wealth and soul. This will be good for you, if you can understand."
ENAA5175,QA5175,ENAA,5175,"He will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing by, and excellent mansions in the garden of Eden. This will be a great fulfilment."
ENAA5176,QA5176,ENAA,5176,And (He will give you) what is dearest to you -- help from God and early victory. So give good tidings to those who believe.
ENAA5177,QA5177,ENAA,5177,"O you who believe, be helpers of God, as Jesus, son of Mary, had said to the disciples: ""Who will help me in the way of God?"" and they had answered: ""We are the helpers of God.""

Yet God prescribes the measure of night and day. He knows you cannot calculate it, and so turns to you in benevolence. So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily. He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be travelling over the earth in search of the bounty of God, and some fighting in the way of God. So read as much from it as you can easily, and be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and lend a goodly loan to God.

ENAA5537,QA5537,ENAA,5537,"""What was it that brought you to Hell?"""
ENAA5538,QA5538,ENAA,5538,"They will answer: ""We did not fulfil our devotional obligations,"
ENAA5539,QA5539,ENAA,5539,"And did not feed the needy,"
ENAA5540,QA5540,ENAA,5540,"And plunged into useless things with those who were obstinate,"
ENAA5541,QA5541,ENAA,5541,And rejected the Day of Judgement as a lie
ENAA5542,QA5542,ENAA,5542,Until the certainty (of death) had come upon us.
ENAA5543,QA5543,ENAA,5543,"So, the intercession of intercessors will not avail them."
ENAA5544,QA5544,ENAA,5544,Why then do they turn away from the admonition
ENAA5545,QA5545,ENAA,5545,As though they were frightened asses
ENAA5546,QA5546,ENAA,5546,Fleeing from a lion?
ENAA5547,QA5547,ENAA,5547,In fact every one of them wants to be given open books (like the prophets).
ENAA5548,QA5548,ENAA,5548,By no means. In fact they do not fear the Hereafter.
ENAA5549,QA5549,ENAA,5549,"Never so, as this is a reminder."
ENAA5550,QA5550,ENAA,5550,Let him then who heeds remember it.
ENAA5551,QA5551,ENAA,5551,"But they will not remember except as God wills: He is worthy to be feared, and He is worthy of forgiving"
ENAA5552,QA5552,ENAA,5552,"I CALL TO WITNESS the Day of Resurrection,"
ENAA5553,QA5553,ENAA,5553,And I call the reprehensive soul to witness:
ENAA5554,QA5554,ENAA,5554,Does man think We shall not put his bones together?
ENAA5555,QA5555,ENAA,5555,Surely We are able to reform even his finger-tips.
ENAA5556,QA5556,ENAA,5556,Yet man is sceptical of what is right before him.
ENAA5557,QA5557,ENAA,5557,"He asks: ""When will the Day of Resurrection be?"""
ENAA5558,QA5558,ENAA,5558,"Yet when the eyes are dazzled,"

ENAA5560,QA5560,ENAA,5560,"And the sun and moon are conjoined,"

ENAA5563,QA5563,ENAA,5563,With your Lord alone will be the retreat on that day.
ENAA5564,QA5564,ENAA,5564,Then man will be told what he had sent ahead (of good) and what he had left behind.
ENAA5565,QA5565,ENAA,5565,"In fact man is a witness against himself,"
ENAA5566,QA5566,ENAA,5566,Whatever the excuses he may offer.
ENAA5567,QA5567,ENAA,5567,Do not forestall (the revelation before its completion) by acting in haste.
ENAA5568,QA5568,ENAA,5568,Surely its collection and recitation are Our responsibility.
ENAA5569,QA5569,ENAA,5569,"So, as We recite it, follow its reading."
ENAA5570,QA5570,ENAA,5570,The exposition of its meaning surely rests on Us.
ENAA5571,QA5571,ENAA,5571,"But no. You love this transient life,"
ENAA5572,QA5572,ENAA,5572,And neglect the Hereafter.
ENAA5573,QA5573,ENAA,5573,"How many faces will be refulgent on that Day,"
ENAA5574,QA5574,ENAA,5574,Waiting for their Lord.
ENAA5575,QA5575,ENAA,5575,And how many faces on that Day will be woe-begone
ENAA5576,QA5576,ENAA,5576,Fearing that a great disaster is going to befall them.
ENAA5577,QA5577,ENAA,5577,"Never so, for when life withdraws into the clavicula,"

ENAA5579,QA5579,ENAA,5579,"He will then realise it is the parting,"
ENAA5580,QA5580,ENAA,5580,And anguish will be heaped upon anguish:
ENAA5581,QA5581,ENAA,5581,To your Lord then will be the driving.
ENAA5582,QA5582,ENAA,5582,"For he neither believed nor prayed,"
ENAA5583,QA5583,ENAA,5583,But only disavowed and turned away;
ENAA5584,QA5584,ENAA,5584,Then he strutted back to his people.
ENAA5585,QA5585,ENAA,5585,"Alas the woe for you, alas!"
ENAA5586,QA5586,ENAA,5586,"Alas, the woe for you!"
ENAA5587,QA5587,ENAA,5587,"Does man think that he will be left alone to himself, free?"
ENAA5588,QA5588,ENAA,5588,"Was he not an emitted drop of semen,"
ENAA5589,QA5589,ENAA,5589,"Then formed into an embryo? Then He fashioned, shaped and proportioned"
ENAA5590,QA5590,ENAA,5590,"And assigned it sexes, male and female."
ENAA5591,QA5591,ENAA,5591,Cannot such as He bring the dead to life?
ENAA5592,QA5592,ENAA,5592,WAS THERE NOT a time in the life of man when he was not even a mentionable thing?
ENAA5593,QA5593,ENAA,5593,"Verily We created man from a sperm yoked (to the ovum) to bring out his real substance, then gave him hearing and sight."
ENAA5594,QA5594,ENAA,5594,We surely showed him the way that he may either be grateful or deny.
ENAA5595,QA5595,ENAA,5595,We have prepared for unbelievers chains and collars and a blazing fire.
ENAA5596,QA5596,ENAA,5596,Surely the devotees will drink cups flavoured with palm blossoms
ENAA5597,QA5597,ENAA,5597,From a spring of which the votaries of God will drink and make it flow in abundance.
ENAA5598,QA5598,ENAA,5598,"Those who fulfil their vows and fear the Day whose evil shall be diffused far and wide,"
ENAA5599,QA5599,ENAA,5599,"And feed the needy for the love of Him, and the orphans and the captives,"

ENAA5608,QA5608,ENAA,5608,There will they drink a cup flavoured with ginger
ENAA5609,QA5609,ENAA,5609,From a spring by the name of Ever-flowing-Salsabil.
ENAA5610,QA5610,ENAA,5610,And boys of everlasting youth will go about attending them. Looking at them you would think that they were pearls dispersed.

ENAA5612,QA5612,ENAA,5612,"On their bodies will be garments of the finest green silk and brocade, and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver; and their Lord will give them a purest draught to drink."
ENAA5613,QA5613,ENAA,5613,"""This in truth is your recompense, and acceptance of your endeavours."""
ENAA5614,QA5614,ENAA,5614,We have revealed the Qur'an to you gradually;

ENAA5618,QA5618,ENAA,5618,Surely men love what hastes away and forget the grievous day (ahead).
ENAA5619,QA5619,ENAA,5619,We created them and fixed their bones and joints; and We could replace them when We like with others like them.
ENAA5620,QA5620,ENAA,5620,This surely is a reminder: Therefore whosoever desires may take the way to his Lord.
ENAA5621,QA5621,ENAA,5621,But you will not desire except as God wills. Verily He is all-knowing and all-wise.
ENAA5622,QA5622,ENAA,5622,He admits whosoever He will to His benevolence. But for the evil-doers He has prepared a painful punishment.
ENAA5623,QA5623,ENAA,5623,"I CALL TO WITNESS those who are sent consecutively,"
ENAA5624,QA5624,ENAA,5624,"And those that strike violently,"

ENAA5641,QA5641,ENAA,5641,Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
ENAA5642,QA5642,ENAA,5642,Did We not create you from contemptible water?

ENAA5645,QA5645,ENAA,5645,Then We facilitated (your birth). How well do We calculate!
ENAA5646,QA5646,ENAA,5646,Alas the woe that day for those who deny!
ENAA5647,QA5647,ENAA,5647,Have We not made the earth a repository
ENAA5648,QA5648,ENAA,5648,"For the living and the dead,"
ENAA5649,QA5649,ENAA,5649,"And placed in it lofty and broad stablisers, and gave you sweet water to drink?"

ENAA5673,QA5673,ENAA,5673,OF WHAT ARE they asking one another?
ENAA5674,QA5674,ENAA,5674,(Is it) of the great announcement

ENAA5676,QA5676,ENAA,5676,Indeed they will come to know soon;

ENAA5678,QA5678,ENAA,5678,"Did We not make the earth a spreading,"
ENAA5679,QA5679,ENAA,5679,The mountains tent-pins?
ENAA5680,QA5680,ENAA,5680,"We created you in pairs,"

ENAA5685,QA5685,ENAA,5685,And placed a lamp therein brightly burning.
ENAA5686,QA5686,ENAA,5686,And We sent down rain from water-laden clouds pouring in torrents
ENAA5687,QA5687,ENAA,5687,"That We may produce from it grain and vegetation,"
ENAA5688,QA5688,ENAA,5688,And orchards full of trees and interlacing boughs.
ENAA5689,QA5689,ENAA,5689,Surely a time is fixed for the Day of Judgement.
ENAA5690,QA5690,ENAA,5690,The day the trumpet blast is sounded you will come in hordes;
ENAA5691,QA5691,ENAA,5691,"The heavens will be opened wide and turn into so many doors,"
ENAA5692,QA5692,ENAA,5692,The mountains put in motion turning into a mirage.

ENAA5699,QA5699,ENAA,5699,"They were those who did not expect a reckoning,"
ENAA5700,QA5700,ENAA,5700,And rejected Our signs as lies.
ENAA5701,QA5701,ENAA,5701,We have kept account of everything in a book.
ENAA5702,QA5702,ENAA,5702,"So taste (the fruit of what you sowed), for We shall add nothing but torment,"

ENAA5704,QA5704,ENAA,5704,"Orchards and vineyards,"
ENAA5705,QA5705,ENAA,5705,"And graceful maidens of the same age,"
ENAA5706,QA5706,ENAA,5706,And flasks full and flowing.
ENAA5707,QA5707,ENAA,5707,They will hear no blasphemies there or disavowals:
ENAA5708,QA5708,ENAA,5708,"A recompense from your Lord, a sufficient gift,"

ENAA5715,QA5715,ENAA,5715,"And those who glide swimmingly,"
ENAA5716,QA5716,ENAA,5716,Then outpace the others swiftly
ENAA5717,QA5717,ENAA,5717,"And direct affairs by command,"
ENAA5718,QA5718,ENAA,5718,The day the convulsive (first blast) shatters convulsively
ENAA5719,QA5719,ENAA,5719,"Followed by the second blast,"
ENAA5720,QA5720,ENAA,5720,"Hearts will pound loudly on that day,"
ENAA5721,QA5721,ENAA,5721,Eyes be lowered in submission.
ENAA5722,QA5722,ENAA,5722,"They say: ""Shall we go back to our original state"

ENAA5725,QA5725,ENAA,5725,"It will only be a single blast,"
ENAA5726,QA5726,ENAA,5726,And they will wake up suddenly.
ENAA5727,QA5727,ENAA,5727,Has the story of Moses come to you
ENAA5728,QA5728,ENAA,5728,When his Lord called to him in Tuwa's holy vale?

ENAA5732,QA5732,ENAA,5732,So he showed him the greater sign;
ENAA5733,QA5733,ENAA,5733,But (the Pharaoh) disavowed and disobeyed.
ENAA5734,QA5734,ENAA,5734,"Then he turned away, deliberating,"
ENAA5735,QA5735,ENAA,5735,"And assembled (his council) and proclaimed,"
ENAA5736,QA5736,ENAA,5736,"Saying: ""I am alone your lord, the highest of them all."""
ENAA5737,QA5737,ENAA,5737,So God seized him for the punishment of the Hereafter and this world.
ENAA5738,QA5738,ENAA,5738,Truly there is a lesson in this for those who fear (the consequences).
ENAA5739,QA5739,ENAA,5739,"Are you more difficult to create or the heavens? He built it,"
ENAA5740,QA5740,ENAA,5740,"Raised it high, proportioned it,"
ENAA5741,QA5741,ENAA,5741,"Gave darkness to its night, and brightness to its day;"
ENAA5742,QA5742,ENAA,5742,And afterwards spread out the earth.
ENAA5743,QA5743,ENAA,5743,"He brought out its water and its pastures from it,"
ENAA5744,QA5744,ENAA,5744,And stabilized the mountains

ENAA5746,QA5746,ENAA,5746,"When the great calamity comes,"
ENAA5747,QA5747,ENAA,5747,"The day when man remembers all that he had done,"
ENAA5748,QA5748,ENAA,5748,"And Hell made visible to him who can see,"
ENAA5749,QA5749,ENAA,5749,Then he who had been rebellious
ENAA5750,QA5750,ENAA,5750,"And who preferred the life of the world,"
ENAA5751,QA5751,ENAA,5751,Will surely have Hell for his abode.
ENAA5752,QA5752,ENAA,5752,"But he who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained his self from vain desires,"
ENAA5753,QA5753,ENAA,5753,Will surely have Paradise for abode.

ENAA5759,QA5759,ENAA,5759,"HE FROWNED AND turned away,"
ENAA5760,QA5760,ENAA,5760,Because a blind man came to him.
ENAA5761,QA5761,ENAA,5761,"What made you think that he will not grow in virtue,"
ENAA5762,QA5762,ENAA,5762,"Or be admonished, and the admonition profit him?"
ENAA5763,QA5763,ENAA,5763,"As for him who is not in want of any thing,"
ENAA5764,QA5764,ENAA,5764,"You pay full attention,"
ENAA5765,QA5765,ENAA,5765,Though it is not your concern if he should not grow (in fulness).
ENAA5766,QA5766,ENAA,5766,"As for him who comes to you striving (after goodness),"
ENAA5767,QA5767,ENAA,5767,"And is also fearful (of God),"
ENAA5768,QA5768,ENAA,5768,You neglect.
ENAA5769,QA5769,ENAA,5769,Assuredly this is a reminder
ENAA5770,QA5770,ENAA,5770,"For any one who desires to bear it in mind,"
ENAA5771,QA5771,ENAA,5771,"(Contained) in honoured pages,"
ENAA5772,QA5772,ENAA,5772,"Exalted and holy,"
ENAA5773,QA5773,ENAA,5773,In the hands of scribes
ENAA5774,QA5774,ENAA,5774,Noble and pious.
ENAA5775,QA5775,ENAA,5775,Accursed is man. How ungrateful is he!
ENAA5776,QA5776,ENAA,5776,Of what substance God created him?
ENAA5777,QA5777,ENAA,5777,"From a single sperm He created, then proportioned him,"
ENAA5778,QA5778,ENAA,5778,Then made his passage easy (at birth);
ENAA5779,QA5779,ENAA,5779,He will then send him to death and have him laid in the grave.
ENAA5780,QA5780,ENAA,5780,Then He will raise him up again when He please.
ENAA5781,QA5781,ENAA,5781,But no. He has not fulfilled what was enjoined on him.
ENAA5782,QA5782,ENAA,5782,Let man therefore consider (the sources of) his food.
ENAA5783,QA5783,ENAA,5783,"We poured down rain abundantly,"
ENAA5784,QA5784,ENAA,5784,Then We cracked the earth open under pressure (of germination)
ENAA5785,QA5785,ENAA,5785,"And We made corn grow,"
ENAA5786,QA5786,ENAA,5786,"And grapes and herbage,"
ENAA5787,QA5787,ENAA,5787,"Olives and dates,"
ENAA5788,QA5788,ENAA,5788,"Orchards thick with trees,"
ENAA5789,QA5789,ENAA,5789,And fruits and fodder:
ENAA5790,QA5790,ENAA,5790,A provision for you and your cattle.
ENAA5791,QA5791,ENAA,5791,But when the great calamity comes
ENAA5792,QA5792,ENAA,5792,"Man will fly from his brother,"
ENAA5793,QA5793,ENAA,5793,"Mother and father,"
ENAA5794,QA5794,ENAA,5794,As well as his wife and children.
ENAA5795,QA5795,ENAA,5795,Each man will have enough cares that day.
ENAA5796,QA5796,ENAA,5796,"Many faces will that day be bright,"
ENAA5797,QA5797,ENAA,5797,"Laughing and full of joy,"
ENAA5798,QA5798,ENAA,5798,"And many will be dust-begrimed,"
ENAA5799,QA5799,ENAA,5799,Covered with the blackness (of shame):
ENAA5800,QA5800,ENAA,5800,"They will be the unbelievers, transgressors."
ENAA5801,QA5801,ENAA,5801,"WHEN THE SUN is folded up,"
ENAA5802,QA5802,ENAA,5802,"The stars turn dim and scatter,"
ENAA5803,QA5803,ENAA,5803,"The mountains made to move,"
ENAA5804,QA5804,ENAA,5804,"The ten-month pregnant female camels are abandoned,"
ENAA5805,QA5805,ENAA,5805,"The wild beasts stampede on the run,"
ENAA5806,QA5806,ENAA,5806,"When the oceans surge and swell,"
ENAA5807,QA5807,ENAA,5807,When souls are reunited (with the bodies)
ENAA5808,QA5808,ENAA,5808,And the little girl buried alive is asked
ENAA5809,QA5809,ENAA,5809,For what crime she was put to death;
ENAA5810,QA5810,ENAA,5810,"When the ledgers are laid open,"
ENAA5811,QA5811,ENAA,5811,"The curtain drawn back from the skies,"
ENAA5812,QA5812,ENAA,5812,"When Hell is set ablaze,"
ENAA5813,QA5813,ENAA,5813,"And Paradise brought near,"
ENAA5814,QA5814,ENAA,5814,(Then) every soul will know what it had prepared (for itself).
ENAA5815,QA5815,ENAA,5815,"So, I call the receding stars to witness,"
ENAA5816,QA5816,ENAA,5816,"The planets withdrawing into themselves,"
ENAA5817,QA5817,ENAA,5817,"The closing night,"
ENAA5818,QA5818,ENAA,5818,"The rising dawn,"
ENAA5819,QA5819,ENAA,5819,"That this is indeed the word of an honoured Messenger,"
ENAA5820,QA5820,ENAA,5820,"Full of power, well-established (in position) with the Lord and Master of the Throne,"
ENAA5821,QA5821,ENAA,5821,Obeyed and worthy there of trust.
ENAA5822,QA5822,ENAA,5822,Your companion is not mad.
ENAA5823,QA5823,ENAA,5823,He had surely seen Him on the clear horizon.
ENAA5824,QA5824,ENAA,5824,He is not chary of making public what is unknown.
ENAA5825,QA5825,ENAA,5825,This is not the utterance of an accursed devil.
ENAA5826,QA5826,ENAA,5826,So whither do you stray?
ENAA5827,QA5827,ENAA,5827,"This is a reminder for all the peoples of the world,"
ENAA5828,QA5828,ENAA,5828,"For those of you who desire to walk the path that is straight,"
ENAA5829,QA5829,ENAA,5829,"Though you cannot desire except as God will, the Lord of all the worlds."
ENAA5830,QA5830,ENAA,5830,"WHEN THE SKY is split asunder,"
ENAA5831,QA5831,ENAA,5831,"And the stars dispersed,"
ENAA5832,QA5832,ENAA,5832,"When the oceans begin to flow,"
ENAA5833,QA5833,ENAA,5833,"When the graves are overturned,"
ENAA5834,QA5834,ENAA,5834,Each soul will know what it had sent ahead and what it had left behind.
ENAA5835,QA5835,ENAA,5835,"O man, what seduced you from your munificent Lord"
ENAA5836,QA5836,ENAA,5836,"Who created you then formed your symmetry, then gave you right proportion,"
ENAA5837,QA5837,ENAA,5837,Shaping you into any form He pleased?
ENAA5838,QA5838,ENAA,5838,Even then you deny the Judgement.
ENAA5839,QA5839,ENAA,5839,"Surely there are guardians over you,"
ENAA5840,QA5840,ENAA,5840,Illustrious scribes
ENAA5841,QA5841,ENAA,5841,Who know what you do.
ENAA5842,QA5842,ENAA,5842,"The pious will surely be in heaven,"
ENAA5843,QA5843,ENAA,5843,The wicked certainly in Hell:
ENAA5844,QA5844,ENAA,5844,"They will burn in it on the Day of Judgement,"
ENAA5845,QA5845,ENAA,5845,And will not be removed from it.
ENAA5846,QA5846,ENAA,5846,How can you comprehend what the Day of Judgement is?
ENAA5847,QA5847,ENAA,5847,How then can you comprehend what the Day of Judgement is?
ENAA5848,QA5848,ENAA,5848,"It is the day when no soul will have power to do the least for a soul, and God's alone will be done."
ENAA5849,QA5849,ENAA,5849,"WOE TO THOSE who give short measure,"
ENAA5850,QA5850,ENAA,5850,"Who insist on being given full when they take from others,"
ENAA5851,QA5851,ENAA,5851,"Whilst when they measure or weigh for them, give less."
ENAA5852,QA5852,ENAA,5852,Do they not think they will be raised (to life) again
ENAA5853,QA5853,ENAA,5853,"On a grievous day,"
ENAA5854,QA5854,ENAA,5854,The day all mankind will stand before the Lord of all the worlds?
ENAA5855,QA5855,ENAA,5855,Indeed the ledger of the wicked will be in (the lowest depths) Sijjin.
ENAA5856,QA5856,ENAA,5856,How will you comprehend what Sijjin is?
ENAA5857,QA5857,ENAA,5857,It is a (repository of) distinctly written record.
ENAA5858,QA5858,ENAA,5858,"Ah the woe that day for those who deny,"
ENAA5859,QA5859,ENAA,5859,Who call the Day of judgement a lie!
ENAA5860,QA5860,ENAA,5860,None denies it but the sinful transgressors.
ENAA5861,QA5861,ENAA,5861,"When Our revelations are recited before him, he says: ""These are fables of long ago."""
ENAA5862,QA5862,ENAA,5862,No. In fact what they have been doing has rusted their hearts.
ENAA5863,QA5863,ENAA,5863,"Therefore they will be screened off from their Lord that day,"
ENAA5864,QA5864,ENAA,5864,Then they will indeed burn in Hell.
ENAA5865,QA5865,ENAA,5865,"They will then be told: ""This is what you had denied."""
ENAA5866,QA5866,ENAA,5866,Surely the ledger of the pious will be in 'Illiyun (heights above the heights).
ENAA5867,QA5867,ENAA,5867,But how will you comprehend what 'Illiyun is?
ENAA5868,QA5868,ENAA,5868,It is a (repository of) distinctly written record
ENAA5869,QA5869,ENAA,5869,Witnessed by those who are honoured.
ENAA5870,QA5870,ENAA,5870,"Verily the pious will be in heaven,"
ENAA5871,QA5871,ENAA,5871,On couches face to face.
ENAA5872,QA5872,ENAA,5872,On their faces you will see the glow of beatitude.
ENAA5873,QA5873,ENAA,5873,"They will be served the choicest wine, sealed"
ENAA5874,QA5874,ENAA,5874,"With a sealing of musk, which those who aspire for the best should desire, --"
ENAA5875,QA5875,ENAA,5875,"Blended with the water of Tasnim, (heights ultimate of evolution),"
ENAA5876,QA5876,ENAA,5876,A fountain from which only they who are honoured drink.
ENAA5877,QA5877,ENAA,5877,The sinners indeed laughed at believers
ENAA5878,QA5878,ENAA,5878,And winked at one another as they passed by them;
ENAA5879,QA5879,ENAA,5879,And when they went back to their people turned to make fun of them;
ENAA5880,QA5880,ENAA,5880,"And when they saw them, they said: ""They have indeed gone astray."""
ENAA5881,QA5881,ENAA,5881,But they were not Sent to be guardians over them!
ENAA5882,QA5882,ENAA,5882,"So, the believers will laugh at the infidels on that day,"
ENAA5883,QA5883,ENAA,5883,Regarding them from their cushioned seats.
ENAA5884,QA5884,ENAA,5884,Will not the infidels pay for what they had done?
ENAA5885,QA5885,ENAA,5885,"WHEN THE SKY is cleft asunder,"
ENAA5886,QA5886,ENAA,5886,"And hearkens to its Lord and is dutiful,"
ENAA5887,QA5887,ENAA,5887,When the earth is stretched out taut
ENAA5888,QA5888,ENAA,5888,"And throws out whatever it contains and is empty,"
ENAA5889,QA5889,ENAA,5889,"And hearkens to its Lord and is dutiful,"
ENAA5890,QA5890,ENAA,5890,"O man, you have to strive and go on striving towards your Lord, then will you meet Him."
ENAA5891,QA5891,ENAA,5891,And he who is given his ledger in his right hand
ENAA5892,QA5892,ENAA,5892,"Will have an easy reckoning,"
ENAA5893,QA5893,ENAA,5893,And will return to his people full of joy.
ENAA5894,QA5894,ENAA,5894,But he who is given his ledger from behind his back
ENAA5895,QA5895,ENAA,5895,"Will pray for death,"
ENAA5896,QA5896,ENAA,5896,But will be roasted in the fire.
ENAA5897,QA5897,ENAA,5897,"He lived rejoicing among his people,"
ENAA5898,QA5898,ENAA,5898,Never thinking he will return.
ENAA5899,QA5899,ENAA,5899,Why not? His Lord was always watching him.
ENAA5900,QA5900,ENAA,5900,"So indeed I call to witness the evening twilight,"
ENAA5901,QA5901,ENAA,5901,"And the night and all it gathers,"
ENAA5902,QA5902,ENAA,5902,"And the moon when at the full,"
ENAA5903,QA5903,ENAA,5903,That you will climb from stage to stage.
ENAA5904,QA5904,ENAA,5904,"So, wherefore do they not believe?"
ENAA5905,QA5905,ENAA,5905,And when the Qur'an is recited to them do not bow in adoration?
ENAA5906,QA5906,ENAA,5906,In fact the unbelievers disavow.
ENAA5907,QA5907,ENAA,5907,But God knows what they harbour in their breasts.
ENAA5908,QA5908,ENAA,5908,"So give them news of painful punishment,"
ENAA5909,QA5909,ENAA,5909,Except those who believe and do the right: For them there is reward unending.
ENAA5910,QA5910,ENAA,5910,"I CALL TO witness the sky (bespangled) with the signs of the Zodiac,"
ENAA5911,QA5911,ENAA,5911,"And the promised day,"
ENAA5912,QA5912,ENAA,5912,"And the witness and the witnessed,"
ENAA5913,QA5913,ENAA,5913,That accursed are the men of the trench
ENAA5914,QA5914,ENAA,5914,"Full of fire fed by faggots,"
ENAA5915,QA5915,ENAA,5915,As they sat around it
ENAA5916,QA5916,ENAA,5916,Witnessing what they had done to the believers!
ENAA5917,QA5917,ENAA,5917,"They had no other reason for hating them except that they believed in God the mighty, worthy of praise,"
ENAA5918,QA5918,ENAA,5918,Whose kingdom spreads over the heavens and the earth. God is witness over everything.
ENAA5919,QA5919,ENAA,5919,"Surely for those who persecute believers, men and women, and do not repent afterwards, is the punishment of Hell, and the punishment of burning."
ENAA5920,QA5920,ENAA,5920,Surely for those who believe and do the right are gardens with rivers running by. That is the greatest success.
ENAA5921,QA5921,ENAA,5921,The grip of your Lord is severe indeed!
ENAA5922,QA5922,ENAA,5922,It is verily He who initiates and repeats.
ENAA5923,QA5923,ENAA,5923,"He is the forgiving and the loving,"
ENAA5924,QA5924,ENAA,5924,"The Lord of the glorious Throne,"
ENAA5925,QA5925,ENAA,5925,Who does as He pleases.
ENAA5926,QA5926,ENAA,5926,Has the story of the hordes
ENAA5927,QA5927,ENAA,5927,Of Pharaoh and Thamud come to you?
ENAA5928,QA5928,ENAA,5928,Yet the infidels persist in denial.
ENAA5929,QA5929,ENAA,5929,But God surrounds them from all sides.
ENAA5930,QA5930,ENAA,5930,This is indeed the glorious Qur'an
ENAA5931,QA5931,ENAA,5931,(Preserved) on the guarded tablet.
ENAA5932,QA5932,ENAA,5932,I CALL TO witness the heavens and the night Star --
ENAA5933,QA5933,ENAA,5933,How will you comprehend what the night star is?
ENAA5934,QA5934,ENAA,5934,It is the star that shines with a piercing brightness --
ENAA5935,QA5935,ENAA,5935,That over each soul there is a guardian.
ENAA5936,QA5936,ENAA,5936,Let man consider what he was made of:
ENAA5937,QA5937,ENAA,5937,He was created of spurting water
ENAA5938,QA5938,ENAA,5938,Issuing from (the pelvis) between the backbone and the ribs.
ENAA5939,QA5939,ENAA,5939,God has certainly power to bring him back (from the dead).
ENAA5940,QA5940,ENAA,5940,The day all secrets are examined
ENAA5941,QA5941,ENAA,5941,He will have no strength or helper.
ENAA5942,QA5942,ENAA,5942,"So I call to witness the rain-producing sky,"
ENAA5943,QA5943,ENAA,5943,"And the earth which opens up (with verdure),"
ENAA5944,QA5944,ENAA,5944,That this (Qur'an) is a decisive word
ENAA5945,QA5945,ENAA,5945,And no trifle.
ENAA5946,QA5946,ENAA,5946,"They are hatching up a plot,"
ENAA5947,QA5947,ENAA,5947,But I too am devising a plan.
ENAA5948,QA5948,ENAA,5948,"So bear with unbelievers with patience, and give them respite for a while."
ENAA5949,QA5949,ENAA,5949,"GLORIFY THE NAME of your Lord, most high,"
ENAA5950,QA5950,ENAA,5950,"Who creates and proportions,"
ENAA5951,QA5951,ENAA,5951,"Who determines and directs,"
ENAA5952,QA5952,ENAA,5952,Who brings out the pastures
ENAA5953,QA5953,ENAA,5953,Then reduces them to rusty rubbish.
ENAA5954,QA5954,ENAA,5954,"We shall make you recite (the Qur'an) so that you will not forget it,"
ENAA5955,QA5955,ENAA,5955,Unless God may please. He knows the visible and knows what is hidden.
ENAA5956,QA5956,ENAA,5956,We shall take you slowly towards ease.
ENAA5957,QA5957,ENAA,5957,So remind them if reminder is profitable:
ENAA5958,QA5958,ENAA,5958,Those who fear will understand.
ENAA5959,QA5959,ENAA,5959,"Only the wretch will turn aside,"
ENAA5960,QA5960,ENAA,5960,"Who will burn in the terrible Fire,"
ENAA5961,QA5961,ENAA,5961,In which he will neither die nor live.
ENAA5962,QA5962,ENAA,5962,"Surely he will succeed who grows in goodness,"
ENAA5963,QA5963,ENAA,5963,And recites the name of his Lord and serves with devotion.
ENAA5964,QA5964,ENAA,5964,"But no, you prefer the life of the world,"
ENAA5965,QA5965,ENAA,5965,Though the life to come is better and abiding.
ENAA5966,QA5966,ENAA,5966,"This is surely in the earlier Books,"
ENAA5967,QA5967,ENAA,5967,The Books of Abraham and Moses.
ENAA5968,QA5968,ENAA,5968,HAS NEWS OF the Overpowering Event reached you?
ENAA5969,QA5969,ENAA,5969,"Many faces will be contrite on that day,"
ENAA5970,QA5970,ENAA,5970,"Labouring, wearied out,"
ENAA5971,QA5971,ENAA,5971,"Burning in the scorching fire,"
ENAA5972,QA5972,ENAA,5972,Given water from the boiling spring to drink.
ENAA5973,QA5973,ENAA,5973,"They will have no food except bitter thorn,"
ENAA5974,QA5974,ENAA,5974,Neither nourishing nor banishing hunger.
ENAA5975,QA5975,ENAA,5975,"Many faces will be joyous on that day,"
ENAA5976,QA5976,ENAA,5976,"Well-pleased with their endeavour,"
ENAA5977,QA5977,ENAA,5977,"In the high empyrean,"
ENAA5978,QA5978,ENAA,5978,Never hearing idle talk.
ENAA5979,QA5979,ENAA,5979,There is a stream of running water in it;
ENAA5980,QA5980,ENAA,5980,"And within it are couches placed on high,"
ENAA5981,QA5981,ENAA,5981,"Goblets set,"
ENAA5982,QA5982,ENAA,5982,"Cushions arranged,"
ENAA5983,QA5983,ENAA,5983,And rich carpets spread.
ENAA5984,QA5984,ENAA,5984,Do they not then ponder how the clouds were formed;
ENAA5985,QA5985,ENAA,5985,"And the heavens, how it was raised high;"
ENAA5986,QA5986,ENAA,5986,"And the mountains, how they were fixed;"
ENAA5987,QA5987,ENAA,5987,"And the earth, how it was spread out?"
ENAA5988,QA5988,ENAA,5988,Remind them; you are surely a reminder.
ENAA5989,QA5989,ENAA,5989,"You are not a warden over them,"
ENAA5990,QA5990,ENAA,5990,"Other than him who turns his back and denies,"
ENAA5991,QA5991,ENAA,5991,In which case he will be punished by God with the severest punishment.
ENAA5992,QA5992,ENAA,5992,To Us is surely their returning;
ENAA5993,QA5993,ENAA,5993,Ours is surely then to reckon with them.
ENAA5994,QA5994,ENAA,5994,I CALL TO witness the dawn
ENAA5995,QA5995,ENAA,5995,"And the Ten Nights,"
